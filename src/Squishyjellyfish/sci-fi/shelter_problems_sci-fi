    "40": "41 | A small, rusted object appears on a table, but no one remembers bringing it inside.",
    "41": "42 | A layer of frost builds up on the inside of one of the walls, despite temperature controls being stable.",
    "42": "43 | Automated doors open and close randomly, as if the system is confused about occupancy.",
    "43": "44 | All plants in hydroponics suddenly wither, despite normal nutrient and water levels.",
    "44": "45 | A deep rumbling sound comes from beneath the floor, but the shelter has no known underground levels.",
