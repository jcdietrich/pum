{"name":"Apocalypse Plot Starter Prompts","type":"simple","entries":{"0":"1 | The Broadcast That Shouldn’t Exist: It’s been five years since the world collapsed—since the power grids failed, since the satellites fell, since radio frequencies went silent. But tonight, at precisely midnight, a transmission crackles through the static. \"Survivors of Sector 12, Haven is real. The gates will open at dawn.\" No one has heard of Haven before. No maps mark its location. The coordinates embedded in the signal lead to the ruins of an old government facility, long thought to be abandoned. The broadcast repeats every hour—until dawn, when it abruptly cuts off. No one knows who sent it. Or if it’s a promise… or a trap.","1":"2 | The Convoy That Never Arrived: A group of traders left three weeks ago, bound for a distant settlement with a convoy of food, fuel, and medical supplies. They should have arrived days ago. Instead, their emergency distress beacon flares to life—weak, barely a whisper through the static. \"Help… don’t… they’re still here… watching…\" Then, silence. The route they took was supposed to be safe—clear of raiders, mutants, or hostile zones. If they didn’t make it through, what else is out there?","2":"3 | The Bunker That Opened Itself: During the first months of the collapse, people sealed themselves away in underground bunkers, waiting for the world above to stabilise. Most never reopened. But today, for the first time in decades, one of them has. The hatch of Bunker 43 stands wide open, its security locks disengaged, its reinforced doors forced outward from within. There should be survivors inside, desperate and malnourished—but the corridors below are eerily silent. No signs of a struggle, no bodies, just dust-covered walls and uneaten rations. Then you hear it—a distant, mechanical voice repeating the same word over and over: \"Recalibrating…\"","3":"4 | The Last City Standing: Out in the wasteland, settlements rise and fall like dust in the wind. But one city—New Bastion—has endured. A fortress of steel and concrete, it is self-sustaining, heavily armed, and too perfect for a world that has fallen apart. Travellers speak of its people being healthy, well-fed, untouched by disease or hardship. Too normal. Too clean. And then the warnings start—\"You can go in, but you won’t leave.\"","4":"5 | The Train That Keeps Moving: A massive freight train still runs through the wasteland, its wheels grinding over rusted tracks, its horns blaring through dead cities. No one knows where it came from or who controls it. Sometimes, it stops at settlements, its doors sliding open to reveal stockpiles of food, water, and fuel. Other times, it carries passengers—silent, expressionless people who stand unmoving, unblinking. The train always waits one hour before departing again. No one who boards ever comes back.","5":"6 | The Storm That Never Ends: A superstorm has formed over the old world, a swirling mass of black clouds thick with radiation and ash. It should have died out weeks ago, but instead, it just keeps growing. Every settlement caught in its path has been levelled, its people wiped away without a trace. Scientists before the collapse warned that climate change would create storms too powerful to stop—but survivors claim there’s something unnatural about this one. That it doesn’t just destroy. It takes.","6":"7 | The Dead City’s Lights: For decades, the ruins of Old Ashford have been nothing but a crumbling skeleton, abandoned and lifeless. Until last night. The city's skyscrapers lit up, neon signs flickered, streetlights glowed, and for a few fleeting moments, the city looked just as it did before the world ended. Then, as suddenly as it started, the lights went dark again. Some say it’s an old-world reactor, finally failing. Others whisper that someone is still living there, still keeping the lights on… waiting.","7":"8 | The Message in the Ruins: Scavengers found something in the wreckage of an old highway—a message, freshly carved into the cracked asphalt. \"Do not enter Zone 17. If you see the lights, run.\" The problem? No one calls it Zone 17. No maps use that designation. It’s just a stretch of broken earth, collapsed buildings, and forgotten roads. But last night, a trader camping nearby swore they saw bright flashes of movement in the distance—silent, fast, and deliberate.","8":"9 | The Forgotten Soldier: In an abandoned military bunker, locked away behind thick security doors, a soldier sits against the wall—still alive. His uniform is decades old, his dog tags coated in dust. At first, you think he’s dead… until his eyes snap open, his breathing shallow but steady. He remembers the war, remembers taking orders yesterday, but his unit hasn’t existed in over fifty years. His name appears in no military records.","9":"10 | The Cult of the Long Night: A travelling group of survivors staggers into town—malnourished, exhausted, barely able to stand. They claim to be the last of their people, their home destroyed by something they only call \"The Long Night.\" They speak of vast shadows, of people disappearing from their beds, of entire towns wiped off the map without a single gunshot fired. And the worst part? They refuse to sleep.","10":"11 | The Warlord’s Toll: In the lawless wastes, warlords rise and fall, but one has endured—Cain \"The Iron Wolf\". His domain stretches across half the old country, his rule enforced by mercenaries and old-world tech. His people are safe, fed, and armed, but everything comes with a cost. You’ve entered his territory, and now you must pay the toll—food, weapons, or blood. Refuse, and you’ll end up as another nameless corpse along the highways.","11":"12 | The Smog That Kills: A toxic smog rolls over the land, choking out the sun, suffocating anything caught in its path. People caught unprepared drop within minutes, their lungs burning from within. Scientists called it the Rot-Fog, a product of the industrial collapse. The problem? It’s spreading. No one knows what fuels it, but last week, a fully sealed bunker was found emptied, its doors still locked from the inside.","12":"13 | The Flooded Wastes: When the ice caps melted, the world drowned. Now, cities are half-submerged, highways vanish into endless water, and the coastlines have swallowed entire nations. But a recent drought has caused the sea levels to fall, revealing something buried beneath the waves. Traders speak of ships stranded miles inland, of ruined towers, of vaults that were never meant to be opened again.","13":"15 | The Black Zone: A vast section of the wasteland is completely lifeless—no plants, no animals, no sounds. Machines die the moment they enter, radios fall silent, and drones never return. No one knows what caused it, but last month, a scavenger staggered out, half-burnt, raving about metal giants… and something watching from the sky.","14":"16 | The Siege of Ironhold: Ironhold is a fortress-city, ruled by General Mathis, an ex-military leader who keeps order through strict discipline and heavy firepower. His soldiers wear old-world uniforms, his citizens live under curfews, and no one speaks against his rule. But another warlord—The Widow, a former revolutionary—has gathered an army to tear Ironhold down. As tensions rise, both sides start recruiting anyone with a gun. The question isn’t whether the city will burn—it’s who will set it alight first.","15":"17 | The Arena of Bones: Deep in the ruins of Old Denver, warlord Cutter Vargas has built a bloodsport empire. Captured survivors, criminals, and even failed warriors from rival factions are thrown into the pit, fighting with knives, blunt weapons, or bare hands for the chance at freedom. The crowd cheers for blood, placing bets, watching from rusted bleachers. But last week, a fighter won seven matches in a row, something no one has ever done. The next morning, they were found stripped of their weapons, dumped outside the city gates, and executed with a single shot to the head. No one knows why, but rumours whisper: \"They saw something they weren’t supposed to.\"","16":"18 | The Trade Prince’s Kingdom: While warlords fight over land and fuel, Dario Malik built an empire on trade. His city, Beacon, is the only place left where commerce thrives, where old-world goods are still bartered, and where money actually means something. But behind the gold-plated gates, slavery, debt contracts, and assassinations keep the system running. No one leaves Beacon without a price on their head. Malik is looking for new enforcers, spies, and debt collectors—those willing to do whatever it takes to keep his kingdom thriving.","17":"19 | The Road Reapers’ Toll: The highways are dead, cracked asphalt swallowed by dust and overgrowth. But one stretch of road, known as The Black Mile, is still operational, kept clear by a gang of road warriors known as The Reapers. They run convoys, charge heavy tolls, and kill anyone who tries to pass without paying. But something’s changed. The tolls have tripled, entire caravans are being stripped clean, and last week, one of their own leaders was found hanging from an overpass. The Reapers are losing control of their own road—and whatever’s taking it from them isn’t human.","18":"20 | The Last Airstrip: Most planes fell from the sky during the collapse. But in the wastelands, one airport still operates, controlled by a warlord called \"Captain\" Redmond, a former pilot who somehow kept his fleet running. His forces rule the skies, running supplies between settlements, dropping bombs on those who defy him. But now, fuel is running out, and his pilots are defecting. With only weeks before his power crumbles, Redmond is offering insane amounts of wealth and protection for anyone who can steal or refine new fuel sources.","19":"21 | The Meat Kings of Salt Plains: Warlord \"Meat King\" Tobias and his family rule the Salt Plains, controlling one of the only large-scale food sources left. They farm cattle, pigs, and more exotic livestock, selling real meat to those who can afford it. But lately, their shipments have been lighter. Traders complain the meat tastes… different. And last week, a caravan found a pile of butchered bodies in the dunes—branded with Tobias’ mark. The King denies any connection, but his guards watch the roads a little too closely now.","20":"22 | The Burned City: What used to be Freehaven was once a beacon of survival, a settlement where refugees found safety from raiders. Then, warlord Silas Brandt arrived. In one night, the entire city was burned to the ground. Now, he sits on a throne of scorched concrete, ruling over the ruins, offering loyalty or death to anyone who comes near. But survivors claim he wasn’t alone when he took the city. They whisper about \"the Black Brigade\", soldiers in sealed suits, their weapons too advanced for this world. No one knows where they came from. No one has seen their faces.","21":"23 | The Damned Water Barons: Clean water is worth more than gold, and the River Lords know it. This warband controls the last functioning filtration plants, trading purified water for labour, fuel, or blood. But last week, the water turned bad. People are dying after drinking it, vomiting black bile, their eyes turning glassy. The River Lords blame sabotage, and now, they’re hunting for someone to track down the source—before it’s too late.","22":"24 | The Fortress of the Damned: An old prison compound, long abandoned, has been taken over by the warlord known as Judge Graves. He and his ex-military enforcers run it like the old world, treating the wasteland like one big crime scene. If you break his laws—whether you knew them or not—you either work the labour pits or face execution. But last week, one of his own high-ranking officers was killed—not by rebels, not by a rival faction, but by someone inside his fortress. And now, Graves is looking for outside help to find the traitor.","23":"25 | The Concrete Kingdom: Inside the ruined superhighways, warlord \"King\" Alistair Crowe has built a city in the wreckage, using the tunnels and overpasses as defensible walls. His people live inside abandoned vehicles, shop stalls built from old train cars, entire families squeezed into buses and trucks that haven’t moved in years. The city thrives, but Crowe is paranoid, convinced an assassin is coming for him. He’s offering a ridiculous bounty to anyone who can find the would-be killer before they strike.","24":"26 | The Sun Has Turned Against Us: The heat has been unbearable for months. What used to be scorching summer days has become an unrelenting furnace, baking the land, boiling rivers dry, turning crops to dust. The air shimmers with heat, and even the nights offer no relief. People are dropping dead in the streets, their skin peeling from prolonged exposure. Scientists before the collapse warned of the tipping point—that one day, the world would just keep heating with no way to stop it. That day has come. And now, the only way to survive is to run from the sun.","25":"27 | The Poisoned Rain:Rain used to be a blessing. Now, it’s a death sentence. The skies are thick with pollution and chemical rot, and every storm that falls eats through metal, burns flesh, poisons the earth. No one dares step outside during the downpours, and those caught in it without protection never live long enough to warn the others. Entire settlements have vanished overnight, their buildings still standing, their people melted away. And worst of all? The storms are coming closer together.","26":"28 | The Red Famine: Nothing grows anymore. The soil is dead, the rivers contaminated, and the last surviving crops are withering faster than anyone predicted. Those who don’t eat meat starve first, and those who do are running out of livestock. Some say the warlords hoard the last of the good seeds, others believe the ground itself has turned against humanity. But one thing is clear—if a solution isn’t found soon, people won’t just die from hunger. They’ll kill for food.","27":"29 | The Last Drinkable Water: Most lakes and rivers aren’t safe anymore—polluted, poisoned, or simply dried up. Now, every warlord, every faction, every survivor wants the same thing—access to one of the last clean reservoirs, hidden beneath the ruins of an old-world research facility. The facility was locked down during the collapse, its gates sealed, its defences still active. To get inside, you’ll need codes no one has seen in decades—or a big enough gun to blow the doors open. The problem? You’re not the only one trying.","28":"30 | The City of the Starved: The survivors in Hollow Ridge have lasted longer than most settlements. Too long. People still look healthy, their clothes still clean, their children still playing in the streets. But the land around them is dead. There are no farms, no fishing spots, no supply chains—so where does their food come from? Travellers who visit the town say the people are friendly, the mayor welcomes newcomers, but every so often, someone disappears. And those who ask too many questions? They’re never seen again.","29":"31 | The Failed Experiment: A pre-collapse research facility has finally been breached. The labs inside held scientists working on genetic enhancements, artificial immune boosters, and forced adaptation to the changing world. Their research was supposed to save humanity. But when the power failed, the doors locked from the inside. The facility was sealed for thirty years. Now the doors are open again, the lights flickering, the sound of movement echoing through the halls. The people inside should be dead. But they’re not.","30":"32 | The Men Who Don’t Die: A group of raiders attacked a settlement last week, killed over twenty people, and walked off without a scratch. The ones who fought back swore they saw bullets hit them—chest shots, headshots, clean kills—but they just kept moving. Now, they’re heading south, wiping out settlements as they go, leaving empty streets behind. No bodies, no survivors, just the feeling that something isn’t right.","31":"33 | The Black Rot: It started in the slums, where people were already weak—open sores, black veins, fevers that never broke. Those infected wasted away, but they never truly died. Their bodies continued moving, their eyes still watching, their whispers still rasping. The disease spreads through blood, through air, through touch. And now it’s here. The only thing that stops it? Fire.","32":"34 | The Forest That Eats People: Out in the wasteland, near what used to be a national park, the trees have started to grow again. They shouldn’t—the soil is dead, the air is toxic, and nothing should be able to take root. But somehow, an entire forest has sprouted overnight, thick and green, stretching for miles. Travellers say it’s the first sign that the earth is healing, but those who go in… never come back.","33":"35 | The Cargo That Was Never Delivered: Decades ago, just before the final collapse, a military convoy was moving high-value cargo across the country. It never reached its destination. Whatever was in those trucks was so important that entire warbands still search for it today. Now, someone claims to have found a half-buried transport vehicle, its doors still sealed, its security systems still active. The only clue to what’s inside? A single stencilled phrase on the side: \"CLASSIFIED: SURVIVAL PRIORITY\".","34":"36 | The Failed Clones: Before the war, some of the world’s wealthiest individuals planned for immortality, funding secret projects to transfer their consciousness into new bodies, perfect genetic copies of themselves. The experiments never saw the light of day—until now. Deep in the wasteland, scavengers have discovered a hidden vault filled with tanks of identical bodies, hundreds of them, all sharing the same face. And last week, one of them woke up.","35":"37 | The Children Who Don’t Grow Old: A hidden settlement was discovered deep underground, home to a group of children who have survived for over forty years. The problem? They haven’t aged. Their clothes are still pristine, their eyes unnervingly clear, and when asked, they simply smile and say they’re waiting for their parents. The settlement was abandoned before the war, and the life support systems should have failed decades ago. So what are they waiting for? And why are they still alive?","36":"38 | The Warborn: Rumours have spread of a new kind of soldier, built in the last days of the war—genetically engineered, trained from birth, designed to endure anything. Their creators are long dead, their bases reduced to rubble, but somehow, they survived. Now, people whisper about warbands moving through the wasteland, uniformed and disciplined, soldiers with no past, no memory, and no fear of death. And one of them is looking for answers.","37":"39 | The Desert of Glass: In the heart of the wasteland, there’s a massive crater, its surface melted into smooth glass, reflecting the sun like a mirror. No one goes near it—the radiation should have killed anything that tried. But scavengers have spotted figures moving across the glass, and last week, a caravan disappeared near its edge. The last radio transmission from their leader was a single phrase, repeated over and over: \"Something’s inside.\"","38":"40 | The Last Human Project: In a forgotten corporate bunker, deep beneath the ruins of a collapsed skyscraper, an AI-controlled lab is still operational. Its mission? Preserve humanity. Its methods? Unclear. The doors have just unlocked for the first time in decades, and the systems inside have continued their work—experimenting, modifying, adapting. The computers still run, the machinery still hums, and something is still breathing inside.","39":"41 | The City Overrun: The city of Holloway was one of the last safe zones, its walls reinforced, its gates secured. Then, the breach happened. Tens of thousands of zombies poured in, overwhelming the defences in a matter of hours. The military sealed the exits, trapping everyone inside—including survivors who weren’t infected. Now, desperate calls for help still echo over the radio, but no one dares go near. The only way in is through an underground sewer tunnel, but if you go in, there’s no guarantee you’ll come back out.","40":"42 | The Graveyard Shift: A group of survivors made their home in an old funeral home, believing the dead inside had already been cremated or buried long before the outbreak. But last night, something started banging on the walls… from the inside. The coffins in the basement, long sealed, have started shaking violently, and the morgue drawers slam open on their own. The survivors thought they were alone. They weren’t.","41":"43 | The Infected Water Supply: A small town has been thriving in the apocalypse, their wells still running with fresh, uncontaminated water. But last week, people started getting sick. Not like a normal infection—this is different. Their eyes cloud over, their breathing slows, and then, one by one, they turn into zombies without a single bite mark. Someone—or something—poisoned the water. And now, the survivors have a choice: find the source before everyone turns, or run while they still can.","42":"44 | The Horde is Coming: Every survivor knows to avoid the horde. Thousands of the undead, packed together, moving like a tide of death, sweeping through entire cities and leaving nothing behind. And now, one is headed straight for your settlement. You have three days before it arrives. There’s no way to fight them, and there’s nowhere to run—unless you find a way to lure them somewhere else. But what could possibly be loud enough, big enough, and important enough to draw their attention?","43":"45 | The Trapped Safehouse: A survivor frantically pounds on the gates of your settlement, begging for help. He and his group took shelter in an abandoned shopping centre, thinking it was safe—until they realised it was a feeding ground. The exits are sealed, the zombies inside are starving, and the remaining survivors are running out of time. They need help escaping, but if you open the wrong door… you’ll be trapped with them.","44":"46 | The Factory of the Undead: A pre-apocalypse pharmaceutical plant still hums with power, its security doors locked, its alarms still active. The company that ran it was developing a \"cure\" before everything collapsed. But when scavengers forced their way inside, they found rows of restrained zombies, still strapped to operating tables, hooked up to machines keeping them alive. One of the monitors still displays a countdown, slowly ticking toward zero. No one knows what happens when it reaches the end… but the doors are starting to unlock.","45":"47 | The Ship of the Dead: A massive cargo ship, half-sunk off the coast, washed up onto shore last night. No crew, no signals, just rows of sealed shipping containers covered in biohazard warnings. Then, one of the containers burst open. The zombies inside had been locked away for years, perfectly preserved in the cold, waiting. Now, they're spreading into the mainland, and no one knows just how many more are still inside.","46":"48 | The Prison Break: An abandoned maximum-security prison has remained sealed since the early days of the outbreak, its gates welded shut, its prisoners left to die inside. No one dared to break it open—until now. A gang of scavengers blew open the main entrance, hoping to loot weapons and supplies. Instead, they unleashed thousands of zombies who had been trapped inside for years, their hunger driving them into a frenzy. Now, the infected are pouring out into the wasteland, and there’s only one way to stop them—seal the prison again from the inside.","47":"49 | The Reanimated Soldiers: A military outpost was believed to have held the line against the undead—until the soldiers stopped responding. The area is still heavily fortified, its walls unbreached, but when a recon team went to investigate, they didn’t find a single living person. Instead, the soldiers were still standing at their posts, still armed, still watching the perimeter. But their eyes were milky white, their bodies rotting beneath their uniforms. Something kept them upright, something made them different. And they’re still following orders.","48":"50 | The Dead Don’t Stay Dead: Survivors have always followed one rule—if someone gets bitten, put them down before they turn. But now? It doesn’t work anymore. People are still turning into zombies—but some of them are coming back completely normal. No sickness, no hunger, no loss of control. Just… alive again. But how long will they stay that way? And what happens when they turn a second time?","49":"51 | The Sun is Killing Us: The heat has become unbearable. Temperatures climb past 60°C in the midday sun, making the wasteland a deathtrap for those caught outside without shelter. The roads are littered with bodies of those who collapsed mid-journey, their skin boiled and cracked. Metal burns at a touch, fuel evaporates within hours, and crops won't grow anymore. Some settlements have started going underground, others are trying to rebuild old cooling systems, but the truth is undeniable—if the heat keeps rising, no one will survive.","50":"52 | The Drought That Won’t End: Rain hasn’t fallen in two years. Wells have dried up, rivers have turned into cracked canyons, and settlements are turning on each other over the last sources of drinkable water. The warlord controlling the only clean reservoir in the region has tripled his prices, demanding labour, weapons, or blood for a single sip. Last week, a trader claimed to have found a fresh water spring deep in the wasteland—but he was shot dead before he could reveal the location. Now, everyone is searching for it.","51":"53 | The Land That Burns: Fires now rage endlessly across the wasteland, feeding on dried-out forests, ruined cities, and old fuel stores. The sky is permanently stained orange, and the air is thick with black smoke that chokes the lungs. Survivors live in a constant state of evacuation, moving from place to place before the flames catch up. Some say there’s a safe zone beyond the burning lands, a place where the air is still clean—but no one knows if it’s real or just another false hope.","52":"54 | The Storms That Shatter Cities: Massive hurricanes, sandstorms, and acid rain now dominate the wasteland, making long-distance travel near impossible. A few ruined skyscrapers still stand, but they’re being worn down by relentless winds. Some settlements have adapted, building storm bunkers and wind turbines, but their numbers are dwindling. The latest storm, a Category 6 superstorm, is heading straight for a survivor hub with over 500 people—and they don’t have enough transport to evacuate everyone in time.","53":"55 | The Rising Tides: The world is drowning. Sea levels have swallowed entire cities, leaving only rooftops and the tops of skyscrapers peeking above the waves. Some survivors live on boats, while others cling to the last pieces of dry land, building makeshift bridges between half-flooded ruins. The problem? The water is still rising. And something lurks beneath the surface, moving through the sunken highways like a predator in its domain.","54":"56 | The Salt Crisis: Once, the ocean was full of life. Now, it’s poison. The desalination plants that once purified seawater are failing, and the few that remain are under siege by desperate survivors. Without a stable source of fresh water, dehydration will kill more people than starvation. A group of scientists claim they have a working purification system, but they need power and resources to make it work—and warlords are already fighting over who will control it.","55":"57 | The Blighted Earth: The land itself has turned against you. Acid soil kills crops, mutated fungi spreads toxins into the air, and entire forests are collapsing under their own decay. Some survivors claim to have found a valley where plants still grow, but the journey is too dangerous—the roads leading there are littered with corpses, all covered in a strange, pulsating moss. If no new farmlands are found soon, the last pockets of civilisation will starve to death.","56":"58 | The Death of Night: For months now, the sky hasn’t darkened. The sun, trapped behind a layer of thick smog and reflected heat, keeps the world in perpetual daylight. With no cool nights to rest, crops won’t grow, water evaporates faster, and people are collapsing from exhaustion. The only way to survive is to dig underground, find shelter, and wait for the sun to finally set—if it ever does.","57":"59 | The Black Oceans: The once-blue oceans are now thick with oil spills, algae blooms, and toxic sludge. Any fish that remain are too poisonous to eat, and even the air near the coastlines burns the throat. A rumour has begun to spread—someone has found a clean water source, deep in the ocean trench, untouched by pollution. But to reach it, you’d have to brave the open waters, where ships are lost without a trace, and something massive moves beneath the waves.","58":"60 | The Air is Running Out: Once, the world had trees, rivers, and a stable climate. Now, oxygen levels are dropping. The combination of heat, pollution, and deforestation has made the air thinner, forcing survivors to rely on filtration masks, oxygen tanks, or underground shelters where the air is still breathable. Some say there’s a green zone—a place where trees still produce clean air—but no one who has gone looking has ever come back.","59":"61 | The Underground Refuge: With the surface world now a scorched wasteland, many survivors have fled underground—into old subway tunnels, bomb shelters, and abandoned mining complexes. But space is running out, and resources are growing thin. Ventilation systems are failing, and the deeper tunnels are collapsing under shifting earth. Some groups have begun digging deeper, desperate for space and resources, but those who go too far don’t return. Something is down there, something old, something waiting.","60":"62 | The Last Floating City: Most of the world drowned when the ice caps melted, but a handful of floating settlements survived. Oil rigs, cargo ships, and artificial islands now serve as the last homes for humanity on the water. But as food supplies dwindle and storms grow stronger, the floating city of New Haven is failing. Some believe they need to expand, scavenge, and rebuild. Others whisper that the only option left is to raid and steal from other survivors. A choice must be made—cooperate or conquer?","61":"63 | The Nomads of the Firelands: Some survivors refuse to settle down. They move with the changing climate, adapting to the land as it shifts beneath them. They travel in convoys, making their homes in repurposed cargo trucks, old-world RVs, and scavenged military transports. They are constantly on the move, avoiding warlords, dodging raider ambushes, and staying ahead of deadly sandstorms. But fuel is running low, and if the convoy can’t find a working refinery or an alternative energy source, they’ll be stranded—helpless in the most dangerous stretch of wasteland left.","62":"64 | The Dome Cities: A few corporate arcologies—massive domed cities designed to protect the elite from the collapse—still stand. Inside, the last remnants of the old world remain: perfectly controlled weather, purified water, untouched food stores. But the domes are failing. Air filters clog with dust, water supplies are running low, and those inside are getting desperate. They need labourers, workers, outsiders—but they won’t let just anyone in. The choice is clear: offer something valuable, force your way inside, or carve out a life beyond the walls.","63":"65 | The Reclaimed Wilds: The wasteland is deadly, but some places are coming back to life. Deep in the ruins, plants have started growing again, reclaiming the land. Mutated forests spread across abandoned highways, rivers carve new paths through collapsed cities, and once-toxic zones are now lush with strange new ecosystems. The land is fertile, but it’s not safe. The animals are larger, faster, more aggressive, and whatever thrives in this new world does not welcome humans. The question is—can humanity find a way to live here, or is this world no longer ours?","64":"66 | Deliver the Cure: A scientist has something no one else does—a potential cure for the sickness that has wiped out entire settlements. It’s not perfect, but it works, and now every faction, warlord, and desperate survivor wants it. The problem? They need to get to a functioning lab to finish the formula, and that lab is over 300 miles away, deep in mutant-infested territory. Every step of the journey is a target on your back, because if you fail, the last hope for a cure dies with them.","65":"67 | Protect the Caravan: A convoy of refugees—over a hundred men, women, and children—has been forced out of their settlement by warlords, their only hope of survival resting on reaching a safe zone in the mountains. Their vehicles are falling apart, their supplies are running low, and the journey will take weeks through a lawless wasteland. Raiders circle them like vultures, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. If the convoy doesn’t keep moving, they’ll never make it.","66":"68 | The Child with the Secret: A young girl, no older than ten, is being hunted across the wasteland by multiple factions. She’s just a child—weak, defenceless, unable to fight—but she knows something, something that could change everything. Maybe she was raised in a hidden lab. Maybe she remembers a place where the world still works. Maybe she’s not fully human. You don’t know yet. All you know is that they want her, and you are the only thing standing between her and the people who will kill to claim her.","67":"69 | The Last Engineer: The world’s infrastructure is collapsing—power grids, filtration systems, hydro generators, everything that once kept humanity alive. But there’s one person left who knows how to fix them—an old-world engineer who was there before it all fell apart. Problem is, they’re being held prisoner by a warlord who knows exactly how valuable they are. The only way to keep the lights on is to get them out alive—but every faction in the region wants them too, and they don’t care who dies in the process.","68":"70 | The Scientist’s Last Mission: The world is poisoned, and what little clean water remains is drying up. But one scientist swears they’ve found a way to purify it—permanently. The research notes are already written, the formula is ready, but the last functioning purification plant is hundreds of miles away, deep in mutant territory. The scientist is old, frail, untrained, and every step of the way, something wants them dead. If you don’t get them to the plant, the water won’t last another year.","69":"71 | The Prisoner Transfer: A notorious war criminal has been captured, a man responsible for slaughtering entire settlements, burning people alive, and leading a ruthless raider army. A settlement has sentenced him to execution, but instead of killing him outright, they want to send him to trial at the last surviving court in the region. Your job is to escort him across the wasteland, but his old allies want him freed, his enemies want him dead, and the people you’re delivering him to? They might not even exist anymore.","70":"72 | The VIP Delivery: A powerful warlord is offering an absurd amount of resources in exchange for one person—alive, unharmed, and delivered to their doorstep. No one knows why. The person being escorted doesn’t even know. They’re not rich, not important, not useful in any obvious way. But someone wants them badly enough to pay for their safe arrival. The problem? Other people want them too. And they’re willing to kill to make sure they never reach their destination.","71":"73 | The Lost Pilgrimage: A religious cult known as The Last Faithful believes there’s a sacred place deep in the wasteland, untouched by war, disease, or disaster. A handful of their most devoted followers have been chosen to make the journey, carrying an ancient relic they believe will guide them to salvation. The problem? They have no idea where they’re going. Their maps are ancient, their resources scarce, and they are woefully unprepared for what’s out there. If you don’t guide them, they’ll all die before they ever see their so-called promised land.","72":"74 | The Defector’s Flight: A high-ranking officer in a brutal warlord’s army has finally had enough. They’ve stolen classified intel, maps, and supply routes, and they’re ready to defect—but only if they can be escorted safely to another faction’s stronghold. Their old allies will stop at nothing to silence them, and their enemies aren’t exactly welcoming. If you can get them to safety, they might tip the balance of power—but if they’re caught, it’s your head on the chopping block too.","73":"75 | The Emergency Evacuation: A failing outpost is seconds away from being overrun. The defences are crumbling, the infected are inside, and the people left behind won’t survive the next hour. A few survivors are ready to evacuate, but they need an escort through the chaos—through burning streets, collapsing buildings, and roads swarming with the dead. There’s no time to plan, no time to prepare—only run, or die.","74":"76 | The General’s Final Order: Before the world fell apart, General Marcus Grant led a last-ditch military effort against the mutant uprising, attempting to wipe out the most dangerous evolved strains before they could spread. The mission failed, and his forces were wiped out. Now, years later, an encrypted pre-recorded transmission has surfaced, containing his final orders. The files describe a location known only as “Vault Zero”, supposedly the site of a secret government lab that may have the key to understanding—if not stopping—the mutation entirely. But if the mutants find it first, it could doom the last human survivors.","75":"77 | The Fortress Siege: A well-armed warband, backed by mutated shock troops, has surrounded a survivor stronghold, demanding its resources, weapons, and people. The defenders can hold out for a while, but their ammunition and food are dwindling. The warband’s leader, Karlox the Twice-Born, was once human but has since evolved into something stronger, faster, and impossible to kill through normal means. He’s given the settlement three days to surrender, or he and his mutants will tear the walls down themselves. Your job? Find a way to stop him—before he makes good on his promise.","76":"78 | The Biohazard Zone: A long-abandoned research facility is leaking a mutagenic contaminant into the air. Survivors nearby have begun showing early signs of mutation—some gaining strange abilities, others suffering horrific deformities. The contamination is spreading fast, and the only hope of stopping it is to get inside the facility and shut it down. But the researchers who worked there didn’t go down without a fight. Their failed test subjects, twisted beyond recognition, are still roaming the halls—and they’re not happy about visitors.","77":"79 | The Nuclear Option: A rogue faction of ex-military personnel, backed by bio-enhanced supersoldiers, has uncovered a functional nuclear warhead—one of the last remaining from the old world. Their leader claims it’s the only way to wipe out the mutant hordes and reset civilisation, but others believe he’s planning to use it against rival factions instead. You’ve been hired to infiltrate their base, determine the truth, and disable the warhead—if you can. But some of the supersoldiers were volunteers… and some weren’t.","78":"80 | The Factory that Won’t Stop: An automated weapons factory—once producing advanced war drones to fight against the first wave of mutations—has been running unattended for decades. Its AI-driven security systems still follow their last orders, treating anything not fully human as a hostile threat. But now, a group of mutant scavengers has broken into the facility, trying to repurpose the technology for their own survival. If they succeed, they could create an army of machines to fight back against humanity. The only way to stop them is to get inside and shut it down—but once you step through the doors, the machines will activate.","79":"81 | The Warband’s Betrayal: A notorious warlord and their army, made up of both humans and mutants, are claiming they’ve changed—no more raiding, no more killing. They offer a truce, promising to bring stability to the wasteland. But an undercover source has revealed the truth: they’re gathering forces for a final war, and when they’re ready, they’ll wipe out every settlement in their way. The problem? Most settlements believe their lie, and no one will act without solid proof.","80":"82 | The Dead Walk Again: A recently bombed-out city was thought to be cleared of zombies and mutants, but now, something is moving in the ruins. Recon teams report strange shapes, flickering lights, and garbled radio signals. The military outpost nearby wants confirmation—are the infected still active, or has something worse taken their place? Some suspect a new mutant strain, something that doesn’t die like the others.","81":"83 | The Silent Convoy: A well-armed military convoy was transporting mutant prisoners to a classified facility, but three days ago, it vanished without a trace. Satellite images show the vehicles still intact, no signs of an ambush, no wreckage. A black box recording from one of the trucks only has one last message: “Something is wrong. We shouldn’t have stopped.”","82":"84 | The Doomsday Cult’s Final Ritual: A group of religious fanatics known as The Ascended believe that mutation isn’t a curse—it’s a blessing. They claim to have found “The True Form”, a way to accelerate evolution and turn humans into something beyond mortal limitations. They’ve already begun kidnapping survivors, forcing them to undergo horrific mutation experiments. Their numbers are growing, and their influence is spreading like wildfire. The problem? No one knows where they’re hiding.","83":"85 | The Bridge to Nowhere: A heavily fortified bridge connects two surviving cities, one ruled by warlords, the other by a struggling democracy. The bridge is the only supply route, and now, a third faction is trying to take control. But among the forces on both sides are mutant mercenaries, warriors enhanced by pre-war genetic experiments. The battle is about to begin, but the question is—are the mutants fighting for their own future, or just being used as weapons?","84":"86 | The Cracked Earth: An earthquake has devastated the wasteland, splitting open the ground and swallowing entire settlements. Some say a lost underground mutant colony was exposed during the collapse, one filled with strange, intelligent beings. Now, both human warbands and mutant survivors are racing to claim the site before the next tremor buries it forever.","85":"87 | The Last Working Airship: A group of scavengers has uncovered an old-world cargo airship, somehow still operational. If it can be restored, it could provide safe travel, trade routes, and supply drops. The problem? Every warlord in the region wants it—and some have mutants in their ranks, willing to tear it apart to keep humans from gaining an advantage.","86":"88 | The Power Plant Standoff: A nuclear power plant still produces a small amount of energy, one of the last in the world. But two rival factions—one human, one mutant—have laid claim to it, both unwilling to stand down. The plant can only power one settlement, and whoever gets it will control the entire region. You’ve been hired as a neutral party to negotiate peace—or sabotage one side before war breaks out.","87":"89 | The Last Supply Drop: A pre-war satellite has finally fallen from orbit, carrying one of the last government-issued supply drops. A parachute was deployed, and its crash site has been located. The drop could contain medicine, clean water, or even military-grade weaponry. But you’re not the only one who knows where it landed—raiders, warlords, and mutant warbands are all converging on its location.","88":"90 | The Final Transmission:An emergency distress call is being transmitted across all frequencies, repeating the same message: “This is Outpost Seven. We are under attack. Survivors remain. We need immediate assistance.” The problem? Outpost Seven was destroyed over a decade ago. No one survived. No one could have sent the signal. And yet, the mutants in the region are reacting strangely, as if they recognise the name"}}
