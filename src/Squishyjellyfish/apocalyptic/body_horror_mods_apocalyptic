1 | Bone Crown: Bony protrusions grow from the user's skull like a twisted, spiked crown. Side Effect: The bone growths are highly sensitive, causing pain when struck or touched.  
2 | Flesh Gills: Red, pulsating gills grow along the user's neck or ribcage, allowing them to breathe underwater or in toxic gas clouds. Side Effect: The gills secrete a foul-smelling mucus that stains clothing and skin.  
3 | Ocular Tumors: Swollen masses filled with fluid grow around the eyes, giving the user "compound vision" similar to an insect. Side Effect: The user experiences headaches due to the overstimulation of visual input.  
4 | Extra Mouth (Abdomen): A second, smaller mouth grows on the user's stomach, capable of speaking, eating, or whispering unsettling secrets. Side Effect: The mouth sometimes speaks uncontrollably in the user's sleep, revealing their hidden thoughts.  
5 | Rotting Flesh Bloom: Parts of the user's body are covered in flesh that constantly rots and regenerates, producing a horrific stench. Side Effect: Flies and vermin are drawn to the user, and the regeneration process is agonisingly painful.  
6 | Bio-Luminescent Veins: The user's veins glow with sickly green or blue light, visible just beneath their skin. Side Effect: The glow makes it impossible to hide in darkness, and the light sometimes pulses in sync with the user's heart rate.  
7 | Chitinous Shell: Sections of the user’s back, shoulders, and limbs are covered in hard, beetle-like carapace plates. Side Effect: The plates are brittle, cracking painfully under extreme pressure, and they emit a sickening crunch when damaged.  
8 | Razorbone Claws: The user's fingers mutate into long, bone-like claws that are sharp enough to tear through flesh and metal. Side Effect: The claws slowly grow over time, requiring the user to file them down regularly, causing nerve pain.  
9 | Parasitic Limb Growth: A small, malformed extra arm or leg grows from the user’s back or torso. Side Effect: The extra limb twitches and moves involuntarily, sometimes interfering with movement or causing discomfort.  
10 | Cyclopean Eye: The user's two eyes merge into a single, large, bloodshot eye in the centre of their face. Side Effect: They have improved depth perception but suffer from "light sensitivity," needing to wear goggles in bright environments.  
11 | Hollow Womb: A fleshy, pouch-like cavity grows in the user's abdomen, capable of carrying objects or small creatures. Side Effect: The cavity has nerve endings, and "something" sometimes moves inside, causing sharp, unexpected pain.  
12 | Fungal Infestation: Fungal growths emerge from the user’s flesh, resembling stalks, mushrooms, or moldy patches. Side Effect: The fungus releases spores when the user is agitated, causing mild hallucinations in those nearby.  
13 | Bone Blades (Forearm): The user's forearm bones extend out of the flesh to form long, jagged blades. Side Effect: The bones ache constantly and must be "reset" back into the arm after use, causing extreme pain.  
14 | Rib-Cage Bloom: The user’s rib cage splits open like a blossoming flower, revealing internal organs that pulse and glow. Side Effect: Exposed organs are vulnerable to damage, and the ribcage only "closes" when the user is calm.  
15 | Leeching Tongue: The user's tongue extends unnaturally far and is tipped with tiny, sharp teeth capable of latching onto skin and drawing blood. Side Effect: Their tongue moves of its own accord during sleep, occasionally lashing at nearby objects.  
16 | Split-Face Syndrome: The user's face is divided down the middle, with one side "normal" and the other twisted, melted, or skeletal. Side Effect: They lose control of one half of their face, resulting in slurred speech and a "grinning corpse" appearance.  
17 | Inverted Knees: The user’s legs twist backwards at the knees, giving them incredible jumping and sprinting ability. Side Effect: Their gait is disturbing and "animal-like," and prolonged running causes searing joint pain.  
18 | Iron Skin Growths: Segments of the user's skin harden into sharp, rusted metal plates, similar to corroded iron. Side Effect: The metal plates cut through clothing, leaving tattered rags behind. Metal detectors also register the user as "armed."  
19 | Tumorous Flesh Clusters: Swollen, tumor-like growths emerge on the user's arms, neck, and torso, some large enough to pulsate. Side Effect: Occasionally, one "pops," releasing foul-smelling fluid. Flies and vermin are drawn to the user.  
20 | Hydra Hands: The user's fingers split into smaller, writhing "mini-fingers," each with its own limited dexterity. Side Effect: The fingers twitch and move constantly, even when the user is asleep, leading to unsettling tapping sounds.  
21 | Grinning Skull Face: The user's facial skin pulls taut, revealing a skeletal, grinning "death mask" appearance. Side Effect: People instinctively avoid them, and their face cannot show normal expressions, leading to miscommunication.  
22 | Serrated Spine: The user's spine extends out of their back like a row of jagged, serrated spikes. Side Effect: Sitting, sleeping, or reclining becomes painful, forcing the user to stand or crouch at all times.  
23 | Multi-Jointed Limbs: The user's arms and legs have additional joints, allowing for unnatural twists, rotations, and grotesque flexibility. Side Effect: Their movements are deeply unsettling to observers, evoking comparisons to insects or possessed puppets.  
24 | Hollow-Eyes Mutation: The user’s eyes become black, empty sockets filled with darkness, yet they can still see. Side Effect: Others feel "watched" in their presence, even when their gaze is averted, and children often cry upon seeing them.  
25 | Flesh Tentacles: Flesh-like tentacles grow from the user’s ribs, back, or shoulders, each able to grasp and move independently. Side Effect: The tentacles act on instinct, sometimes grabbing objects (or people) without the user's consent.  
26 | Twisted Mandibles: The user’s jaw warps into an insect-like maw with sharp mandibles capable of tearing through meat and bone. Side Effect: They struggle to speak clearly, producing chittering and hissing sounds that terrify children and animals.  
27 | Nerve Cluster Growth: Bulging nerve clusters grow along the user's spine or forearms, giving them enhanced sensitivity. Side Effect: The nerve growths pulsate visibly, and intense pain is felt when touched, making them vulnerable to torture.  
28 | Third Arm Protrusion: A third arm grows from the user’s chest or back, often smaller but just as functional. Side Effect: The third arm twitches when the user is asleep, often grabbing blankets, pillows, or people.  
29 | Plague Maw: The user's mouth is permanently "too wide," stretching from ear to ear, filled with jagged, needle-like teeth. Side Effect: The user has difficulty eating normal food, relying on liquid diets or shredded meat. Their grin is permanently unsettling.  
30 | Bioluminescent Eyes: The user's eyes glow with an eerie green, blue, or red hue, allowing them to see in the dark. Side Effect: Their eyes glow constantly, revealing their location to others in darkness and making them an easy target for ranged attackers.
