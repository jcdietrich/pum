    "0": "1 | The First Infection:The world still seems normal, but strange reports have begun appearing—violent attacks, people biting each other, unexplained fevers. No one is saying zombies yet, but something isn’t right. You’ve witnessed one of the first infections up close—a loved one, a co-worker, or a stranger turning into something inhuman. The authorities are downplaying the danger, but you know the truth: this is just the beginning.",
    "1": "2 | The Evacuation Attempt: A military broadcast urges civilians to evacuate to a designated safe zone, promising food, shelter, and protection. The roads are jammed, the infected are spreading faster than expected, and as the panic worsens, the government stops responding. Now, you must decide—fight your way to the safe zone, find another way out, or hunker down and hope for the best.",
    "2": "3 | The Last Flight Out:The final evacuation plane is scheduled to leave from a heavily fortified airbase, but you're nowhere near it. The radio is crackling with desperate military instructions, warning that once the plane departs, no further rescue missions will be sent. The roads leading to the airbase are choked with abandoned cars, panicked civilians, and worsening chaos. You need to get to the airstrip before the final call—whether by stealing a vehicle, taking dangerous back routes, or finding someone who can get you past the growing checkpoints and blockades. But every wasted second means less chance of making it before the last plane is gone forever.",
    "3": "4 | The Quarantined Town: Your town has been sealed off, surrounded by military barricades, and no one is allowed to leave. The official reason? A deadly virus outbreak. But power is starting to flicker, food is running low, and no one has seen a soldier in days. The only way out is through a blockade swarming with the dead—or worse, the desperate survivors who have their own plans.",
    "4": "5 | The Bunker That Wasn’t Safe: You’ve made it into a government bunker, one of the few supposed safe zones left. The security is tight, the rations are stockpiled, and the survivors inside seem relieved to have made it. But something is wrong. The food isn’t being replenished. The guards are nervous. And people are disappearing in the night. What’s really happening down here?",
    "5": "6 | The Hospital Nightmare: You wake up in a hospital bed, the last thing you remember is a car crash, a routine surgery, or collapsing from exhaustion. The building is eerily silent, the staff nowhere to be seen. Then you hear the gurgling moan from the hallway. Outside the window, the city is burning. The infection has already begun—and you’re trapped inside with it.",
    "6": "7 | The Abandoned Safe Zone: Word spread that a military safe zone was still operational—a large fortified area promising protection, food, and medical aid. It took you days to get here, scavenging supplies and avoiding both infected and desperate survivors. But when you finally arrive, you find the gates hanging open, the barricades partially collapsed, and eerie silence in place of the bustling haven you expected. There are no bodies, no signs of a struggle—just half-eaten meals left on tables, unfinished conversations on radio logs, and the unsettling sense that whoever was here left in a hurry. Then, just as you're about to turn back, a radio crackles to life—a single voice whispering, \"You need to leave. Now.\"",
    "7": "8 | The Road of the Dead: A long highway stretches ahead, once a major motorway, now reduced to a graveyard of wrecked cars, makeshift camps, and abandoned convoys. Somewhere beyond this stretch of ruined asphalt lies your next destination—a rumoured safe zone, a hidden stash, or a reunion with lost loved ones. The problem? Fuel is scarce, gangs have set up ambush points, and the infected roam freely, lurking in the shadows of tunnels, service stations, and overturned lorries. Every mile forward is a gamble, and turning back isn't an option.",
    "8": "9 | The Military Betrayal:A heavily armed military convoy arrived in your area, promising security and escorting civilians to a secure location. At first, things seemed safe—the soldiers were well-equipped, food and water were distributed, and order was restored. But something felt off. Survivors started disappearing at night, whispers of people being taken away in chains spread among the group, and no one who questioned the orders was ever seen again. Then, you overheard something you weren’t supposed to—the \"safe zone\" isn't what they claim. Now, you need to escape before you're next.",
    "9": "10 | The Last Broadcast: A looping radio transmission echoes across the ruined world, the voice robotic, repeating the same cryptic phrase: \"Sanctuary still exists. There’s a way out.\" The signal never changes, never provides coordinates—only a direction and a promise. You aren’t the only one who’s heard it—other survivors are already moving towards the source, hoping that it’s not just another trap. But as you get closer, the world itself seems wrong—strange symbols painted on abandoned buildings, missing people whose voices echo in the static, and a growing sense that whoever is broadcasting... is waiting.",
    "10": "11 | The Ghost Town: After weeks of travelling through ruined cities, burned-out suburbs, and forests teeming with infected, you come across something unbelievable—a town that seems completely untouched. The buildings stand intact, windows unbroken, cars still parked neatly in driveways. Supermarket shelves are still fully stocked, there’s no sign of struggle—no bodies, no dried blood, no barricades. The place looks like everyone just left mid-routine, abandoning their lives without reason. It should be a blessing, an easy place to rest and recover, but the silence is unnerving. No animals, no buzzing flies, no wind knocking loose shutters—just eerie stillness. As night falls, you hear footsteps in the distance, slow and methodical, but when you check, there’s nothing there. Something is watching.",
    "11": "12 | The Family You Left Behind: The outbreak spread so fast, there was no time to reach your family. No calls went through, the roads were gridlocked with panicked civilians, and before you knew it, entire cities were overrun. You’ve been surviving ever since, barely scraping by, but the thought won’t leave you—are they still alive? Do they even know what happened to you? The journey back won’t be easy; the roads are dangerous, gangs control certain areas, and there’s no guarantee you’ll find anything but a ruined home filled with memories and corpses. But you have to know. You have to see it for yourself.",
    "12": "13 | The Scientist’s Secret: An exhausted, half-starved scientist stumbles into your camp, bloodied but alive. They claim to have been part of a high-level research team working on an early-stage cure—before their lab was overrun. They barely escaped with their life, but their notes, the hard data they need, are still inside. If you help them get back into the lab, they swear they can find something valuable—a vaccine, an immunity treatment, maybe even a way to stop the infection entirely. But something doesn’t add up. They refuse to say what happened to the rest of their team, and when pressed, they change the subject. What aren’t they telling you? And why does it feel like you’re being watched?",
    "13": "14 | The Mall Siege: A massive shopping centre stands in the middle of a crumbling city, its steel shutters sealed tight, its parking lot turned into a makeshift barricade. Inside, survivors have formed warring factions, each claiming their own sections—the supermarket, the electronics store, the upper floors. You came here for food and supplies, but leaving might be harder than getting in. The infected press against the outer barriers, drawn by the sound of infighting. The leader of one faction is asking for your help—take their side, and they’ll let you stay. But the other group says they have a better way—they’ve found a tunnel leading out, but it’s dangerous. Do you fight for a place in the mall, or risk the unknown path?",
    "14": "15 | The Island Escape: Rumours have been spreading about a distant island, untouched by the outbreak—a place where the infected can’t reach, where crops still grow, where people are living normal lives. The problem? You need a boat, fuel, and a crew willing to risk crossing the open sea. Dockyards are crawling with infected, and the last boat you found had holes in the hull and no engine. Worse, some survivors don’t want you to leave. They need you for their own plans, and they’ll do whatever it takes to keep you from escaping.",
    "15": "16 | The High-Rise Hell: You’ve been surviving in a massive skyscraper, a former luxury apartment building turned fortified survival tower. It was safe—until now. The lower floors have been breached, and the infected are working their way up. You have two choices—fight your way down through corridors choked with the undead, or go up, trying to escape across the rooftops, scaffolding, and fragile bridges connecting neighbouring towers. Some survivors say the building’s penthouse still has a working helicopter, but no one has seen the owner in weeks.",
    "16": "17 | The Convoy Gone Wrong: You were supposed to be part of a convoy, a heavily armed group travelling to a safe settlement. The plan was simple—stick together, watch each other’s backs, make it through hostile territory. Then, on the third night, someone betrayed the group. Explosions tore through the vehicles, gunfire erupted in the dark, and by morning, half the convoy was gone. The survivors are pointing fingers, tensions are high, and you need to figure out who set this up—before they finish the job.",
    "17": "18 | The Cult of the Dead: A strange group of survivors has made their home in a ruined cathedral, decorating the walls with symbols in blood, speaking in whispers about “The True Change.” They claim the infected are not monsters, but the future. They don’t fear the dead—they worship them. At first, they seem welcoming, offering food, shelter, and protection. But as the days pass, their smiles feel forced, their kindness too perfect. Then you notice how many survivors enter the church… but never leave.",
    "18": "19 | The Winter Dead: A harsh winter has swept across the land, burying the world in deep snow and freezing winds. The infected have slowed, their bodies stiff and brittle in the ice, making travel safer than before. But it’s only temporary. You need food, fuel, and warmth, and the moment the thaw begins, they’ll all rise again. Will you take the risk of looting the frozen ruins, or fortify your shelter and prepare for the inevitable flood of the dead?",
    "19": "20 | The Bridge Standoff: A massive suspension bridge stretches across a deep river canyon—the only passable route for miles. On one side, a group of survivors has barricaded themselves in, claiming they control the bridge. On the other, a rival group refuses to let them hold it. Both sides are desperate, and you need to get across. They offer two choices—join them, or turn back. But at night, you can hear something moving beneath the bridge, moaning in the dark.",
    "20": "21 | The Train of the Doomed: An old railway line is still operational—someone has restored power to a massive train, running a loop between ruined cities and wilderness outposts. The passengers say it’s the last safe way to travel, but there’s something wrong. Carriages are locked off, the crew refuse to answer certain questions, and at night, you can hear scratching sounds from inside the cargo hold.",
    "21": "22 | The Walled Ruins: An entire city district has been walled off, its streets eerily silent, its buildings still standing. There are no signs of life, no movement—just a towering steel barricade keeping whatever is inside from getting out. The infected must still be in there, but no one knows how many. Some say there’s a weapons cache inside, others believe there’s a working generator, while a few survivors swear they saw a single light flickering from a tower window at night. The gates are rusted but not locked. Whatever is inside has been sealed away for a reason.",
    "22": "23 | The Lake of the Drowned: A vast, still lake stretches across the horizon, its surface unbroken, reflecting the sky like a mirror. It should be a perfect place to rest, a rare source of clean water in the wasteland. But there’s a reason no one stays here long. The shoreline is littered with bones, old tents left abandoned, and the docks have rotted into the water. Locals warn that when the sun sets, things move beneath the surface, and if you stare too long into the dark water, you might see something staring back.",
    "23": "24 | The Survivor Settlement That Won’t Let You Leave: You finally find a thriving settlement, its walls reinforced, its defences strong. The people seem welcoming, well-fed, organised—a rarity in this world. They let you in, offer food, shelter, even a place among them. But after a few days, you notice something unsettling. The main gates are always locked. The guards at the perimeter watch you closely. When you mention leaving, they laugh—no one leaves. Ever. Are they trying to keep you in, or keep something else out?",
    "24": "25 | The Stadium of the Dead: A massive sports stadium looms over the city, its gates reinforced, its structure still intact. It could be the perfect safe zone—high ground, plenty of space, and more than enough room to grow food or house survivors. But when you get close, you realise someone else had the same idea. The entrances are covered in dried blood, the floodlights flicker sporadically, and the field inside is covered in unmoving bodies. Something happened here—and it’s not over yet.",
    "25": "26 | The Train Yard Horde: A sprawling train depot sits on the outskirts of the ruined city, filled with motionless locomotives and rusting cargo containers. It could be a goldmine of supplies—fuel, tools, maybe even an operational engine. But the area is unnaturally quiet, and some of the train cars are shaking slightly, as if something inside is trying to get out. You could take your time checking each carriage, or risk opening one and seeing what’s really waiting inside.",
    "26": "27 | The Forest of the Wandering Dead: Deep in the wilderness, far from ruined cities, the infected should be less common. But here, the woods aren’t safe. You’ve heard the stories—infected wandering in circles, their bodies caught in tree roots, trapped in endless loops through the misty undergrowth. Some survivors say that if you stay in the forest too long, the dead begin following you, slowly, patiently, for miles. You need to get through without attracting too many… or without getting lost among them.",
    "27": "28 | The Underground Metro: A city’s underground subway tunnels still exist, stretching for miles beneath the surface—an escape route, or a death trap. Some survivors claim you can travel safely between ruined districts using old maintenance tunnels, avoiding the dangers above. Others warn that the deeper tunnels are filled with things worse than the infected. Dim emergency lighting still flickers in some sections, while others are pitch-black, filled with the echoes of distant, shuffling feet. If you go down, you might not come back up.",
    "28": "29 | The Caravan of the Lost: A convoy of armoured trucks and survivors on foot is slowly making its way through the wasteland, constantly moving, never stopping for long. They seem well-armed, cautious but open to trade. If you travel with them, you’ll have safety in numbers—for a while. But the group is divided, arguing over where to go next, and you quickly realise some of them don’t trust each other. Some of them might even be infected, hiding their symptoms. How long before the entire convoy collapses?",
    "29": "30 | The Forgotten Prison: An abandoned prison complex looms ahead, its fences still standing, its watchtowers intact. It should be the perfect fortress—high walls, thick doors, built to keep people in. But as you step inside, the air is thick with the stench of decay. The cells are open, some filled with mummified corpses, others suspiciously empty. The prison records end abruptly, mentioning an emergency lockdown, but there are no signs of a final stand, no firefight, no mass graves. Whatever happened here, the last inmates didn’t just die… they vanished.",
    "30": "31 | The Docks That Never Sleep: A vast network of shipping containers and half-sunken cargo ships stretches along the coastline, a forgotten relic of pre-outbreak trade routes. Entire supplies of food, medical gear, even weapons could be buried beneath the rusting metal. But the docks are never truly empty. The infected here don’t roam aimlessly—they seem drawn to the water, standing knee-deep in the tide, staring at nothing. Some survivors believe they never drown, even when dragged under. Others say at night, they come crawling back up from the sea.",
    "31": "32 | The Empty Farmland: You’ve stumbled across a massive farmstead, its fields still intact, its irrigation systems running. A place like this could sustain survivors for years—if it weren’t for one major problem. There are no bodies, no infected, no signs of a struggle. The farmhouse doors stand open, the meals on the table left uneaten, and the livestock in the pens are long dead, but not from the infection. The only clue? A single word scratched into the barn door: RUN.",
    "32": "33 | The Secret Bunker: A heavily reinforced government bunker, hidden beneath an old industrial site, has remained sealed since the first days of the outbreak. The entrance is locked tight, the security systems still functional, and a warning sign states that anyone who attempts to enter will be shot on sight. But last night, a distress signal was broadcast on an emergency frequency—\"We're still alive. We need help.\" Is someone really inside? And if they are, why haven’t they opened the doors themselves?",
    "33": "34 | The Burning City: A once-great metropolis is now an inferno, its skyscrapers collapsing, its streets flooded with infected. The fires have been burning for weeks, and no one knows who started them. You’ve heard rumours of a small survivor group trapped inside, possibly with military-grade supplies. But the smoke is toxic, the bridges are collapsing, and between the flames and the dead, there may be no way out once you enter.",
    "34": "35 | The Military Compound Overrun: A military stronghold once promised safety to civilians, but now it stands in ruins. The fences are torn down, the watchtowers empty, and the only movement comes from shambling corpses in fatigues. Inside, stockpiles of weapons and rations remain untouched, but something feels off. The soldiers' bodies weren’t mauled or eaten—they were executed. Whoever did this may still be inside, waiting.",
    "35": "36 | The Experiment That Escaped: You find an abandoned research station, its halls covered in strange symbols, its doors locked from the outside. Scattered documents hint at human experimentation, secret tests on captured infected—attempts to control them, to alter them. The logs end suddenly, right as the experiments seemed to be working. The infected inside are different, faster, smarter… and they know you’re here.",
    "36": "37 | The Radio Tower Standoff: A functioning radio tower stands tall above the ruined world, broadcasting an automated distress call. Whoever controls it has the ability to reach survivors, coordinate rescues, or mislead people into traps. When you arrive, two rival groups are already fighting for control. One claims they want to warn survivors about the infected hordes heading this way; the other insists the tower should be shut down before it attracts more of the dead. With the fight escalating, you must decide—who do you trust? Or do you take the tower for yourself?",
    "37": "38 | The Underground Laboratory: A rumour spreads of a hidden underground facility, a place where the government or a private corporation studied the infection before the collapse. If the lab still exists, it could hold invaluable research, medical supplies, even a vaccine. But no one knows exactly where it is—only that those who go looking for it never return. The only clue? A single notebook, recovered from a dead researcher, with the last words \"We were wrong. We never should have opened it.\"",
    "38": "39 | The Survivor Ship: A large cargo ship, its engines still running, is drifting just offshore, trapped in shallow waters near a ruined dockyard. There are lights on inside, and sometimes at night, you swear you see figures moving along the decks. No distress signals have been sent, no one responds to radio calls, and yet the ship remains operational. If there are survivors aboard, why haven’t they tried to leave? Or worse—what if they can’t?",
    "39": "40 | The Horde is Coming: A massive horde of infected—thousands strong—is moving across the landscape, destroying everything in its path. No walls have stopped it. No safe zone has survived its approach. You have days, maybe hours, before it reaches your current location. You could run and abandon your supplies, try to fortify your defences, or come up with a desperate last-minute plan—but one thing is certain: the dead are coming, and they won’t stop until there’s nothing left."
