1 | Fallout Shelter: A rusted steel bunker with flickering emergency lights and decades-old survival supplies. The air smells of metal, rot, and old rubber.  
2 | The Subway Catacombs: An abandoned subway system filled with crumbling platforms, flickering lights, and the distant sound of trains that never arrive.  
3 | Ration Vault: A secure vault where food, water, and medical supplies were stored. The vault door hangs open, and many of the shelves are now empty.  
4 | Collapsed Mine Shaft: A once-functional mine now partially caved in. Claustrophobic tunnels twist in all directions, some of which have "scratch marks" leading deeper.  
5 | Overgrown Utility Tunnels: Vines, roots, and moss have taken over an old sewage system. Giant mushrooms glow faintly, and distant splashes hint that you’re not alone.  
6 | Underground Refugee Camp: A former subway platform or basement where survivors built a makeshift shelter. Broken furniture, campfires, and scattered belongings lie abandoned.  
7 | Black Vault: A hidden, reinforced vault containing pre-apocalypse government secrets. Every monitor still displays "LOCKDOWN ACTIVE" in bold red letters.  
8 | Drainage Tunnels: A network of large, circular drainage pipes beneath the city. Water drips constantly, and the darkness ahead feels endless. Rats scurry past, fleeing something larger.  
9 | Radiation Bunker: A heavily shielded room lined with lead panels, Geiger counters, and decontamination showers. There's a metallic taste in the air.  
10 | Forgotten Cryo Facility: An underground cryogenic lab where pods still hold frozen "survivors." Several pods have gone dark, and some show cracks in the glass.  
11 | Underground Survival Colony: A self-sufficient settlement carved into the rock. Handmade signs warn of "NO OUTSIDERS" as eyes watch you from behind curtains.  
12 | Sunken Church Crypt: The church above has collapsed, revealing a flooded crypt below. Water drips constantly, and shapes move beneath the surface.  
13 | Old Missile Silo: A decommissioned missile silo now used as a hideout. Rust coats every surface, and the launch room is filled with makeshift sleeping areas.  
14 | Blood Pit: An old, underground fighting arena where survivors once battled for food. Bloodstains cover the ground, and cages line the walls.  
15 | Rat King's Lair: A massive underground sewer chamber where swarms of rats scuttle across piles of trash, bones, and discarded relics of the old world.  
16 | Bio-Lab Ruins: An underground research facility filled with shattered glass tanks and skeletal remains of "test subjects." Strange fluid still leaks from the pipes.  
17 | Flooded Cavern: A natural cave now half-flooded with brackish, freezing water. The water moves when you don't, and ripples hint at unseen creatures.  
18 | Smuggler’s Tunnel: A secret passage once used by smugglers to move supplies and weapons. Broken crates with strange symbols lie scattered along the tunnel.  
19 | Raider’s Catacombs: The bones of the dead line these crumbling stone passageways, along with flickering torches and signs of recent raider activity.  
20 | Flesh Nest: A cavern where pulsating, fleshy growths cover the walls and ceiling. Bone-like structures poke out from the walls, and the "floor" shifts underfoot.  
21 | Power Substation: Beneath the city, an old power grid substation still hums with electricity. Exposed wires spark, and humming sounds distort into faint, ghostly voices.  
22 | Collapsed Factory Basement: A collapsed factory hides a lower basement where tools, workbenches, and industrial machines lie in disrepair. Rusted gears still spin slowly.  
23 | Hibernation Vault: Rows of hibernation pods with humans still inside, their faces frozen in peaceful sleep. One pod is cracked open. The glass is broken from *inside*.  
24 | Underground Temple of Ash: A hidden temple buried by volcanic ash. The air is suffocating, and crumbling stone carvings depict strange rituals.  
25 | Cracked Containment Unit: A quarantined room with shattered glass walls, broken hazard suits, and a flickering "BIOHAZARD ALERT" sign. Footprints lead away from the containment breach.  
26 | Chain Pit: A deep, circular pit lined with dangling chains and hooks. Below, faint movements can be seen, and the sounds of something scraping echoes upward.  
27 | Vault of Relics: A pre-apocalypse storage bunker filled with memorabilia from the old world. VHS tapes, posters, and unopened cans of soda cover the shelves.  
28 | Sleeping Horde's Nest: A subway station or large chamber where dozens of zombie-like creatures lie in a "hibernation" state, twitching lightly as if dreaming.  
29 | Bloodsoaked Ritual Chamber: Bloodied handprints and arcane symbols cover the walls of this underground chamber. The altar still drips with fresh blood.  
30 | Hollow Husk Cavern: Deep underground, humanoid figures carved from stone stand like statues. As you pass, their "heads" slowly turn to follow your movement.
