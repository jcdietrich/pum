11 | Glow-Eye Adaptation: Eyes glow with faint green or blue light, allowing for enhanced night vision. Side Effect: The glow makes it difficult to hide in darkness, and insects are drawn to the light.  
12 | Grappling Claws: The user's fingers develop sharp hooks and retractable claws, allowing them to climb walls and cliffs. Side Effect: The claws extend randomly during sleep, sometimes piercing bedding or people nearby.  
13 | External Muscle Weave: Synthetic muscle fibres grow outside the user's skin, boosting strength but giving a grotesque, "flayed" appearance. Side Effect: Extreme sensitivity to weather changes causes muscle cramps and spasms.  
14 | Amphibious Lungs: The user's lungs are modified to breathe underwater or in toxic gas clouds. Side Effect: Breathing on land sometimes feels "heavy," like inhaling dense air.  
15 | Acid Spit Gland: A small sac in the throat produces a caustic liquid that can be spit at enemies or obstacles. Side Effect: The taste of acid lingers in the mouth, causing chronic bad breath.  
16 | Bark-Skin Shell: The user's skin hardens into a bark-like texture, resistant to slashes and cuts. Side Effect: The user sheds old bark layers, leaving piles of skin fragments behind.  
17 | Dustborn Carapace: A hardened exoskeleton grows over the user’s chest and shoulders, acting as natural armour. Side Effect: The carapace restricts upper body flexibility, reducing the user's ability to twist and bend.

20 | Flesh Storage Pouch: The user’s abdomen develops a marsupial-like pouch, allowing them to store small items safely. Side Effect: The pouch occasionally "closes" unexpectedly, trapping items inside.  
21 | Split-Jointed Limbs: Extra joints form in the arms and legs, allowing for enhanced flexibility and twisting. Side Effect: The user's movements become unsettlingly "spidery," making others uncomfortable.  
22 | Bone Marrow Converter: Bone marrow produces excess blood, allowing faster healing from wounds. Side Effect: The user feels constantly hungry due to the energy required for increased blood production.  
23 | Drought-Survivor Skin: The user’s body can go weeks without water, surviving on minimal hydration. Side Effect: Their skin becomes dry, flaky, and cracked, resembling desert rock.  
24 | Dual Heart System: The user grows a second heart, allowing for increased stamina and endurance. Side Effect: The user’s chest emits faint "double heartbeats," audible when it's quiet.  
25 | Carrion Immunity: The digestive system is modified to consume spoiled, rotting food with no risk of illness. Side Effect: The user’s sense of taste is permanently reduced, making all food taste bland.  
26 | Enhanced Blood Clotting: Cuts, stabs, and wounds seal themselves in seconds, minimising blood loss. Side Effect: Clots sometimes form randomly in veins, causing temporary pain in the user's limbs.  
27 | Thorn-Vein Arms: Organic thorns grow beneath the user’s skin, emerging from their forearms when needed for combat. Side Effect: Occasionally, the thorns emerge by accident, piercing their clothing.

29 | Stone-Gut Digestion: The user's stomach becomes hyper-dense, allowing them to digest rocks, dirt, and other inorganic materials. Side Effect: The user gains weight and becomes unnaturally "dense," sinking in water.  
30 | Bone Plating Ribs: The user’s ribcage extends outwards, forming natural bone armour around the chest and abdomen. Side Effect: The ribs press against the lungs during intense physical activity, making it harder to breathe.  
31 | Wasteland Scent Tracker: The user’s nose develops enhanced olfactory senses, allowing them to track enemies like a bloodhound. Side Effect: Overpowering scents like gasoline or chemicals cause disorientation and nausea.  
32 | Bloodthirst Adaptation: Hunger and thirst are replaced by a desire for raw flesh, allowing the user to draw nutrition from meat alone. Side Effect: The user’s eyes turn red, and their teeth are stained a permanent dull yellow.  
33 | Death Grip (Tendril Muscles): The user’s forearm muscles develop "tendril bands" that grip tighter with every pull, creating a vice-like grip. Side Effect: The tendrils sometimes "lock up" during sleep, causing the user to crush items they hold.  
34 | Radiation Sense: The user can "sense" areas with high radiation and locate contaminated zones. Side Effect: Their eyes emit faint green or blue light, glowing like radium.  
35 | Flesh Parasite Host: A parasitic symbiote lives inside the user, granting them enhanced strength during battle. Side Effect: The parasite demands sustenance in the form of raw meat once per week.
