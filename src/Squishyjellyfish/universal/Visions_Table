1 | The Shattered Mirror: You stand in front of a tall mirror, but your reflection isn’t quite right. It moves with a slight delay, smiles when you don't, and slowly cracks begin to spiderweb across its surface. Before it fully breaks, the reflection leans forward, whispers, “I’m coming,” and vanishes as the glass shatters into darkness.

2 | The Endless Staircase  
You’re climbing a spiral staircase. The higher you climb, the steps become softer, like flesh. As you glance downward, the stairs below have melted into red, pulsing tissue. At the top, a large, unblinking eye stares at you, and you awaken with the sensation of being watched.

3 | The Crow’s Warning: A large black crow perches on a branch, staring directly at you. It speaks in a raspy, human-like voice: “Three will fall before the sun is gone.” It flies toward you and pecks at your eye. You wake up clutching your face.

4 | The Flooded Room: You’re standing in a dimly lit room with ankle-deep water. Every time you take a step, the water rises. By the time it’s up to your neck, you see shadowy figures swimming beneath you. Just before you’re pulled under, you wake up coughing as if you'd been drowning.

5 | The Hollow Feast: A grand dining hall stretches before you, filled with lavish, steaming dishes. The guests are seated but have no faces. They raise their utensils in perfect unison and eat, but the food never diminishes. One of the faceless figures turns to you, points with a fork, and tilts its head unnaturally.

6 | The Candle’s Glow: You’re in a pitch-black room. A single candle sits before you, flickering softly. Each flicker shows flashes of faces, objects, and places—familiar but wrong. Every time the candle’s light goes out for a split second, you hear a voice whisper a single word in a language you don't understand.

7 | The Open Door: There’s a door in front of you that’s slightly ajar. You hear something faint, like sobbing, coming from behind it. You’re compelled to push it open, but no matter how hard you push, it never opens further. The sobbing grows louder until it’s right next to your ear. You wake up sweating.

8 | The Whispering Forest: You’re walking through a dense forest at twilight. The leaves rustle, but there’s no wind. Whispers surround you, echoing from every direction. They chant your name, over and over. When you turn around, all the trees are facing you, their bark twisted into faces.

9 | The Faceless Parade: A procession marches through a foggy street—musicians, dancers, and masked figures. They turn to look at you as they pass. But none of them have faces beneath their masks. One of them reaches out and offers you a mask of your own.

10 | The Sinking Island: You’re on a small island surrounded by an endless sea. Slowly, the island begins to sink beneath your feet. No matter where you run, the water’s edge gets closer. As you’re about to be submerged, you see something massive—a shape—moving below the waves.

11 | The Man in the Red Cloak: You’re walking through a crowded marketplace. Every figure around you moves like they’re underwater—slow and weightless—except for one. A man in a red cloak moves with unnatural speed. He’s staring at you. No matter where you move, his eyes follow. When you blink, he’s gone.

12 | The Howling Maw: A cavernous mouth appears beneath you—not a pit, but an actual mouth with cracked, decaying teeth and a tongue that’s slowly moving. It’s breathing. The air pulls you downward. It’s whispering something in a familiar voice. As you’re pulled toward it, you hear someone scream your name.

13 | The Shattered Sky: The sky above you is fractured like glass. Through the cracks, you see another sky—one with a blood-red sun and something enormous crawling behind it. Pieces of the sky begin to fall, and one lands in front of you, revealing a piece of your own face reflected in it.

14 | The Garden of Hands: You’re walking through a garden where flowers grow from human hands. As you approach, the hands twist toward you, opening and closing like they’re grasping for something. One of them points toward a small door set into the garden’s stone wall.

15 | The Quiet Bell: You hear a bell toll, but the sound is muffled and slow, like it’s underwater. The ground beneath you ripples, and your feet sink into it like mud. Every bell toll feels heavier, like gravity is increasing. By the final toll, you can’t move, and you wake up gasping for breath.

16 | The Silent Crowd: A crowd of people surrounds you, but none of them speak. They’re all looking at you. Their mouths are open, but no sound comes out. One by one, they kneel, eyes still locked on you. You feel a hand on your shoulder from behind, but when you turn, there’s nothing there.

17 | The Burning Tree: A massive tree is on fire, but it’s not being consumed. The flames are black, and their crackling sounds like human laughter. A figure walks from the flames—it looks like you, but something about it is off. Its eyes are hollow and smoke is pouring out.

18 | The Hall of Doors: You’re in a hallway with an infinite number of doors stretching in both directions. Every door is identical except for one. It’s painted black and scratched as if something was trying to claw its way out. You hear a single knock from the other side.

19 | The River of Masks: A slow-moving river of masks drifts by—hundreds, perhaps thousands. You see faces you recognise, faces you’ve never seen, and even your own face among them. One of the masks tilts upward, staring at you. Its eyes blink.

20 | The Pale Figure: You see a pale figure in the distance. It’s standing perfectly still, hands at its sides. No matter how far you walk, it’s always the same distance away. Then, it’s suddenly in front of you. Its face is featureless except for its mouth, which slowly stretches into a smile as it whispers, “Wake up.”

21 | The Blood Moon Horizon: A red moon hangs low in the sky, so close you can see its craters. Its surface begins to shift as if something is crawling beneath it. The horizon tilts unnaturally, and the moon’s glow floods your surroundings with crimson light.

22 | The Marionette Puppeteer: You’re in a room filled with marionettes hanging from the ceiling. One of them is your exact likeness. It twitches, then slowly raises its head. Strings connect to your hands, and you feel a sudden, irresistible compulsion to move along with it.

23 | The Howling Wind: A violent wind blows around you, but nothing is disturbed. It sounds like distant howling wolves. You see pawprints forming in the dirt, moving toward you, but no animals are there.

24 | The Cracked Mask: You’re wearing a mask you can’t remove. A sharp crack runs down the centre of it, and through the crack, you see a second face staring back at you—one that smiles as you scream.

25 | The Impossible Cliff: You stand at the edge of a cliff. The ocean below shifts and rises, forming faces in the waves that call out to you. The edge of the cliff crumbles beneath you, and you begin to fall.

26 | The Wailing Bell: A distant bell rings, louder each time. You feel compelled to walk toward it, but your feet sink into the ground with every step.

27 | The Bone Orchard: A field of trees made entirely of bones stretches as far as the eye can see. Skulls hang from branches like fruit.

28 | The Endless Battlefield: Corpses and broken weapons stretch into the horizon. The sound of a distant battle never ceases.

29 | The Ocean of Eyes: The water ripples as thousands of eyes stare from beneath the surface.

30 | The Laughing Moon: The moon twists into a grinning face that chuckles softly.
