{"name":"Faction Motivation","type":"simple","entries":{"0":"1 | Sworn to Revenge – They were exiled generations ago, stripped of land and name. Now they sharpen old grudges into knives and swear never to bow again.","1":"2 | The End is Coming – They alone survived a prophetic vision of the world's collapse. While others mock, they build shelters and stockpiles beneath the surface.","2":"3 | Purity Through Power – Once ruled by chaos, they now believe the weak must be cut away. They cleanse cities, minds, and histories in pursuit of order.","3":"4 | The Chosen Bloodline – A single child or heir runs through every ceremony and scar. Their mission is to protect that line, even if it means tearing down kingdoms.","4":"5 | Chains Behind Them – Born in bondage or servitude, they now dismantle every system that once held them down—with fire, sabotage, and absolute refusal to kneel.","5":"6 | Ashes of Home – Their homeland was razed, not forgotten. Every banner they fly is stitched from mourning. They rebuild not for glory—but so it will never happen again.","6":"7 | Betrayed by Kin – Their founder trusted once, and it cost them everything. Now they teach that loyalty is earned in blood and never freely given.","7":"8 | Scavengers of the Golden Age – They pick through ruins, not for profit but for memory. Each relic recovered is a thread back to a time that made sense.","8":"9 | Guilt as a Compass – They unleashed a catastrophe—perhaps a weapon, perhaps a betrayal. Now they atone obsessively, even when no one remembers what they did.","9":"10 | Building the Utopia They Were Denied – Once promised peace and equality, only to be betrayed. Now they will force a better world into being, even if it breaks bones.","10":"11 | Feeding the Immortal – Their leader does not age. It is unclear if that is miracle or curse. Their every move protects this being… or keeps them contained.","11":"12 | Guardians of Forbidden Truth – Their archives are filled with truths others buried. They suffer isolation, mockery, and raids—but they never stop preserving.","12":"13 | Tearing Down the Illusion – They believe society is a lie propped up by puppeteers. Their mission: unmask the liars, even if they must destroy everything first.","13":"14 | Shaped by Plague – A sickness rewrote their way of life. They worship antiseptic, control, and the ability to choose who lives and who is locked outside.","14":"15 | Waiting for the Lost Heir – A child disappeared—either kidnapped, dead, or divine. They prepare for their return obsessively, never questioning if it’s all myth.","15":"16 | Living the Lie – Everything began as a deception—false god, forged prophecy, staged miracle. Now it has followers, temples, blood spilled. The truth cannot come out.","16":"17 | Memorial Warriors – They lost an entire generation in a war no one speaks of. Their festivals, training, and even their names are shaped by grief no outsider feels.","17":"18 | Made Monstrous, Made Proud – They were altered, physically or mentally. Shunned for what was done to them, now they embrace it, calling themselves beautiful.","18":"19 | Emotional Austerity – They saw what love, grief, and longing did. Now they cut feeling from themselves, teaching discipline, detachment, and merciless precision.","19":"20 | Rage of the Forgotten – Their ancestors were crushed by those now praised in textbooks. Every statue, every anthem is an insult. Their fire burns in silence—until it doesn't.","20":"21 | Sacred Voices Only They Hear – The gods fell silent for everyone else. But to them, the voices remain—commanding, loving, or terrifying.","21":"22 | Persecuted into Power – They were branded heretics, hunted, jailed, and burned. But they lived—and now they teach the flames to others.","22":"23 | Lab-Grown or Bred for War – Made as tools, now free. But freedom means vengeance, reclamation, and reminding the world it never owned them.","23":"24 | Not From Here – Their origin is elsewhere—underground, off-world, or beyond time. They see this world as a cracked mirror, never to be trusted.","24":"25 | Proving Supremacy – They aren’t trying to be better. They already believe they are. The world just needs reminding, and blood tends to do that well.","25":"26 | Shaped by Disaster – Earthquake, voidstorm, magical burn—whatever it was, it broke them. Now they build machines, barriers, and rules to never be weak again.","26":"27 | Knowledge Brokers – They trade in secrets like currency. Whispers, scandals, locations. Information doesn’t save lives—it decides which lives matter.","27":"28 | Born in Indoctrination – They do not know freedom. Their scripts are memorised, their loyalty bred into bone. They smile as they march.","28":"29 | The Founder’s Shadow – Their creator vanished mid-sentence. Now every step they take tries to finish that thought, even if no one knows what it was.","29":"30 | They Are the Protagonists – They’ve written themselves as saviours, rebels, chosen. And they cannot comprehend that anyone else might be the hero.","30":"31 | Worshipping the Ruined Machine – A dead AI, forgotten god, or sentient relic rests in their temple. It doesn’t speak. But they remember.","31":"32 | Mutants by Choice – They inject, alter, graft and reprogram themselves. To them, this is not abomination—it’s liberation.","32":"33 | False Prophet, Real Followers – Their leader is a fraud, a shell, a puppet. But belief is stronger than truth—and the masses will protect the lie with blood.","33":"34 | History Fanatics – They re-enact battles, speak dead languages, and dress like empires long past. To them, the future is rot—the past was glory.","34":"35 | The World is a Prison – They think the stars are barred, the land cursed, the sky a dome. Their mission is escape, even if it means tearing open reality.","35":"36 | Ignored Until They Made Noise – No one listened to them before. Now their weapons and bombs force attention. They aren't interested in talking anymore.","36":"37 | Grief-Welded Brotherhood – They all lost something on the same day. Their traditions are grief rituals sharpened into blades.","37":"38 | No Love, No Chaos – They see desire, family, longing as diseases. Their training cuts out the heart, replaces it with law and silence.","38":"39 | Vanishing Lineage – Their people are few. Their names are fading. So they carve their mark into history before history forgets them.","39":"40 | Broken Weapon, Free Mind – They were built to serve. Now they’ve broken the chains, and they don’t care what burns on their path.","40":"41 | Ritual Without Meaning – Their rites are centuries old, but no one remembers what they meant. Still, the dances continue. The knives are still sharp.","41":"42 | Truth Through Blood – Everything they teach is based on a myth—but questioning it gets you exiled. Or worse.","42":"43 | Mastery of Death – They revere mortality: defying it, controlling it, or using it as a tool. No one dies without purpose.","43":"44 | The Forgotten Army – They were the first to bleed in a war that no longer matters. Now they fight simply to exist.","44":"45 | Scrapped Tool Turned Terror – They were made to win wars. When peace came, they were discarded. Now they war for themselves.","45":"46 | Thrives on Weakness – Their survival depends on sabotaging others. A broken world is easier to rule.","46":"47 | Shadows of Society – They live beneath the cities, within the cracks. And they know everything above will fall.","47":"48 | Bound by Cursed Legacy – Their ancestor made a deal with something vast and cruel. Now the faction pays the price, generation after generation.","48":"49 | One Enemy, One Goal – A rival line, family, nation once wronged them. Their entire structure exists to erase that name from memory.","49":"50 | Faith by Suffering – Pain is holy. Every lash, every burned offering, every loss makes them purer.","50":"51 | Rebuilding Lost Tongue and Lore – Their history was stolen. They now guard every rediscovered word like treasure.","51":"52 | Civilisation is a Plague – They see the cities as sickness. The only cure is flame, nature, or silence.","52":"53 | Dream-Walkers – One member had a dream. Now they all follow it, believing it showed the true future.","53":"54 | They Serve What Watches – Something beyond human—an entity, AI, spirit—guides them. Maybe it loves them. Maybe it’s using them.","54":"55 | Culture as Retaliation – They were told their language, music, skin, gods were wrong. Now they scream it into the world.","55":"56 | Guarding the Unreal – They believe in something no one else sees. It may not be real, but they’ve built their lives around protecting it.","56":"57 | They Thrive in Shadows – Cast out long ago, now they’ve made the darkness a home. They don’t want the light anymore.","57":"58 | War Born, Warbound – They were made in rebellion. Now that the fight is over, they look for the next one.","58":"59 | Custodians of the Regretful – They protected evil once. Now they try to make amends by ensuring it never returns.","59":"60 | War is Revelation – They see battle as the purest form of truth. Everything else is politics, lies, or weakness.","60":"61 | Every Child Matters – Their young were taken. Now every child is sacred—and any threat to one is a call to war.","61":"62 | They Know Too Much – A hidden truth destroyed them. Now they destroy to keep it buried—or to make the world suffer with them.","62":"63 | Freedom at Any Cost – Laws are lies. They believe only in choice—even if that choice leads to death.","63":"64 | Sacrifice is Love – They will give anything for their cause. And they expect you to give, too.","64":"65 | Envy Given Flesh – They were denied the throne, the glory, the lover. So now they make sure no one else keeps it either.","65":"66 | Dead Inside, Dangerous Outside – They believe they already died—emotionally or physically. So nothing scares them now.","66":"67 | Oath-Bound to a Ghost – They swore to protect someone long dead. And they still live by that promise.","67":"68 | Honour Above All – They follow a code no outsider understands. But every blade they raise follows it.","68":"69 | Legacy is Everything – They care only about what’s remembered. Their works are monuments. Their failures, erased.","69":"70 | Their Gods Died – And no one cared. So now they make the world remember—with fire, with screams, with loss.","70":"71 | Leaderless and Lost – Their last great leader fell. Since then, they wander—but they’re still dangerous.","71":"72 | Masters of Control – They manipulate food, water, power, belief. Not for greed—but because order is the only thing keeping the chaos out.","72":"73 | Burning Down Empire’s Ashes – They were raised among ruins. They’d rather see smoke than scaffolding.","73":"74 | Dreamlines and Visions – Their plans come from dream-rituals or hallucinations. Logic doesn't matter—faith does.","74":"75 | Perfection Obsession – Every failure shames them. Every blemish is corrected—with steel or silence.","75":"76 | They Obey What They Don't Understand – Their leaders speak in riddles. But the violence is clear.","76":"77 | Built from Survivors – Everyone in this faction lost something. They will never lose again.","77":"78 | Hollowed by Betrayal – They opened their gates once. They’ll never do it again.","78":"79 | Raised in Secrecy – They were born underground, in shadows. They find light blinding.","79":"80 | Shamed and Sworn – They made a mistake once. Now everything is proof they’re better.","80":"81 | Tyrant-Broken – They served evil once. Now they serve justice. Sometimes, too harshly.","81":"82 | The World Misunderstands Them – So they force it to understand—on its knees.","82":"83 | Accidental Existence – They weren’t meant to survive. Now they want to matter.","83":"84 | They Won’t Fail Again – They let something slip once—an empire, a sibling, a city. That mistake defines them now.","84":"85 | Because Power Feels Good – They tried obedience, mercy, compromise. It never felt this good."}}
