{"name":"Coming Out Moments and Reactions","type":"simple","entries":{"0":"1 | Quietly Confessed – The words come out softly, in the stillness of a shared walk or quiet evening. The silence after is long, but not cold.","1":"2 | Interrupted Mid-Confession – Just as the truth is spoken, something interrupts—footsteps, laughter, a sudden knock. The moment hangs unfinished.","2":"3 | Blurted Without Planning – It slips out mid-conversation, unexpected even to the speaker. They freeze. The room falls still.","3":"4 | Rehearsed But Shaky – After days of practising in mirrors, the words still tremble. Voice cracks, hands shake, but they speak anyway.","4":"5 | Responded With a Smile – No words, just a warm smile and a simple nod. Acceptance is immediate, quiet, and deeply felt.","5":"6 | Deflected With a Joke – The listener laughs it off—not cruelly, but awkwardly. They change the subject, unsure how to respond.","6":"7 | Tearful Relief – They fall into an embrace, tears from both. It’s been held in too long. The truth tastes like freedom.","7":"8 | Cold Silence – The response is nothing. No words. No glance. Just silence. It's hard to tell what it means.","8":"9 | Whispered in the Dark – Lying side by side in the dark, one voice whispers it into the stillness. A shared breath follows.","9":"10 | Withheld Until Pressed – It’s only said when questioned directly. The tone is careful. Defensive. Still, it’s honest.","10":"11 | Laughed At, Then Apologised For – The first reaction is a startled laugh—but they catch themselves. Guilt shows in their eyes.","11":"12 | Unexpectedly Warm – You expected the worst. But they just say, “Alright.” Like it was never a question.","12":"13 | Shocked Pause, Then Support – Surprise lingers in their eyes, but the words that follow are careful and kind.","13":"14 | Met With a Question – “Are you sure?” Not to dismiss, but to understand. The tone is curious, not cruel.","14":"15 | Hug First, Words Later – Before anything is said, arms wrap tight. Reassurance in touch before speech.","15":"16 | Not Taken Seriously – “It’s just a phase.” The words sting, even if the tone tries to be gentle.","16":"17 | Defended By a Stranger – Someone overhears, and before the reaction turns sour, a voice speaks up. “That’s brave.”","17":"18 | Private Support, Public Distance – They’re kind in private, but avoid the subject around others. Their care feels conditional.","18":"19 | Shared Experience – Their own truth spills out in return. A bond forms. Something quiet but important connects them now.","19":"20 | Slow Realisation – You don’t even say it directly. But they figure it out, piece by piece—and they don’t pull away.","20":"21 | Immediate Change of Topic – “Okay,” they say—and then talk about the weather. It’s clear they’re uncomfortable.","21":"22 | Embraced Without Words – They don’t say anything. Just pull you into a hug and hold tight. It says enough.","22":"23 | Heated Reaction – Voices raise. Emotions spark. It wasn’t meant to go this way, but it’s out now.","23":"24 | Calm but Distant – “That’s fine,” they say. But there’s something colder behind their eyes.","24":"25 | Celebrated Loudly – “That’s brilliant!” They cheer, too loudly, too publicly—but their joy is real.","25":"26 | Gently Changed the Subject – They don’t reject you, but they step around it. Carefully. Purposefully.","26":"27 | Came Out Together – You weren’t alone. They were waiting for the same moment. Relief, shared in unison.","27":"28 | Not the First Time They Heard – “I know,” they say, almost amused. “I figured it out a while ago.”","28":"29 | With a Gift – Later that day, they hand over something simple—flowers, a charm, a token. “Just because.”","29":"30 | With Love, But Boundaries – They care. They love you. But it might take time for them to understand—and they admit it."}}
