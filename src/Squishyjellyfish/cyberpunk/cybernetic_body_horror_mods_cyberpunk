1 | Parasite Limb: An additional cybernetic limb (arm or leg) that moves independently of the user’s control, driven by a rogue AI subroutine. Side Effect: The limb acts on its own during moments of high stress or fear, sometimes grasping at nearby objects or people.  
2 | Flesh-Window Chest: A reinforced glass window is embedded in the user’s chest, revealing the inner workings of their heart, organs, and cybernetics. Side Effect: The user's heart is now visible, beating visibly behind the glass, which often unnerves others.  
3 | Grinder Jaws: The user's jaw is replaced with rotating metal grinders designed to crush bone, metal, and flesh alike. Side Effect: User can no longer speak clearly and emits a low grinding noise whenever the jaw moves.  
4 | Spider Leg Limbs: Arms or legs have been replaced with multiple, insect-like mechanical limbs, allowing for wall climbing. Side Effect: The constant clicking of the limbs causes unease in others, and the user leaves behind distinctive scratch marks wherever they walk.  
5 | Hollow Eye Sockets: The user's eyes are removed, replaced with black, hollow sockets lined with tiny, blinking LEDs. Side Effect: The sockets emit soft "camera shutter" sounds when scanning nearby faces.  
6 | Steel-Tipped Nerve Wires: Nerve endings extend from the user’s fingertips as long, needle-like cables that can interface with electronics. Side Effect: The wires twitch and spasm unpredictably, even when not in use, giving the impression of writhing tendrils.  
7 | Inverted Faceplate: The user’s face has been replaced with a smooth metal plate that occasionally shifts to reveal fragmented digital faces. Side Effect: Faces of random strangers flicker across the plate, including distorted versions of the user's original face.  
8 | Chest-Mounted Manipulator Arms: Two small, cybernetic arms sprout from the user's chest, primarily used for precision tasks. Side Effect: The arms constantly twitch when idle, and sometimes reach toward people nearby as if curious.  
9 | Circuit-Vein Body Art: The user's veins are replaced with glowing circuit-like lines that pulse with electric current. Side Effect: The user's body sometimes "flickers" like a damaged hologram, causing panic among witnesses.  
10 | Torsion Limbs: The user’s limbs are hyper-flexible, able to twist, bend, and rotate 360 degrees. Side Effect: Their movements look unnatural and insect-like, causing onlookers to feel discomfort or nausea.  
11 | Exposed Muscle Augments: Synthetic muscle fibres are exposed beneath transparent skin, visibly flexing and contracting with every move. Side Effect: The synthetic muscles produce a wet, squelching sound with every movement, disturbing anyone nearby.  
12 | Voice Chamber Throat: The user's voice is generated by a small speaker chamber embedded in their throat, capable of switching between multiple voices. Side Effect: Occasionally, random "radio static" echoes from their mouth during normal speech.  
13 | Sawtooth Elbows: The user's elbows are lined with rotating sawblades that activate in close-quarters combat. Side Effect: The blades emit a shrill, grinding noise when deployed, and produce sparks during use.  
14 | Insectoid Exoskeleton: The user’s entire body is encased in a carapace-like exoskeleton made from cybernetic plates. Side Effect: When they walk, it produces the "chittering" sound of insect legs scraping metal, and their body often drips lubricant.  
15 | Flayed Arm Prosthetic: The cybernetic arm has no "covering" or synthetic skin, exposing the wires, hydraulics, and pistons beneath. Side Effect: The arm constantly leaks oil, leaving a trail of black stains on everything the user touches.  
16 | Reverse Leg Joints: The user's legs have been altered with backward-facing knee joints for increased jumping and sprinting ability. Side Effect: Their gait becomes unsettlingly animalistic, and they emit a faint "creaking" sound with every step.  
17 | Hatch-Torso Storage: The user’s torso has a fold-out hatch, allowing them to store small items like weapons or contraband. Side Effect: The hatch frequently "clicks" as it self-checks its locking mechanism, even while closed.  
18 | Meat-Belt Cyber Waist: The user’s lower torso is replaced with a metallic "belt" covered in writhing, semi-organic tendrils that assist with movement. Side Effect: The tendrils twitch and curl when idle, sometimes "grabbing" nearby objects.  
19 | Hollow Gaze Optics: The user's eyes have been replaced with empty "void pits" that absorb all light, making them appear eyeless. Side Effect: Witnesses feel like something is staring at them from within the darkness of the user’s gaze.  
20 | Barbed Spine Prosthetic: The user's spine is externally reinforced with sharp, barbed vertebrae that rise from their back like a jagged ridge. Side Effect: The barbs tear through clothing, making it impossible for the user to wear anything other than cloaks or robes.  
21 | Hydraulic Jaw Clamps: The user's jaw has a clamp mechanism that can snap shut with crushing force, strong enough to break bones. Side Effect: The jaw occasionally "clamps" involuntarily, causing the user to bite down hard on their own tongue.  
22 | Gore-Piston Fist: One of the user's arms is a massive hydraulic "piston puncher" designed to deliver devastating strikes. Side Effect: Every punch sounds like a gunshot due to the pressure release system, and the arm leaves a bloody "impact ring" on whatever it strikes.  
23 | Shutter-Eye Vision: The user’s eyes are covered by a cybernetic shutter, which clicks open and shut like a camera iris. Side Effect: The "click-click" noise is constant, unnerving everyone nearby.  
24 | Bone-Shear Blades: Razor-sharp bone-like cybernetic blades extend from the user’s forearms. Side Effect: The blades rattle and produce a "bone scraping metal" sound when they are unsheathed.  
25 | Face Splitting Mask: The user's face splits open vertically to reveal hidden tools, cameras, or weapons inside their head. Side Effect: The face emits a "mechanical splitting" sound whenever it opens, and it takes several seconds to re-align.  
26 | Weeping Skin Vents: The user’s skin has small vent holes that release steam or coolant, resembling "sweat." Side Effect: The vents ooze a viscous black fluid when the user overheats, giving them the appearance of "bleeding oil."  
27 | Monolithic Eye: The user’s head is replaced with a single large eye that takes up most of their face, able to track targets in all directions. Side Effect: The eye's iris never stops moving, twitching even when the user is asleep.  
28 | Maw-Chest Cavity: A gruesome maw with razor-sharp teeth is embedded in the user’s torso, opening on command to consume objects. Side Effect: The maw sometimes "chews" while the user is asleep, creating wet, gnashing sounds.  
29 | Wirebound Hands: The user's fingers are replaced with flexible "cable tendrils" that can stretch, twist, and strangle targets. Side Effect: The tendrils constantly "unwind" and re-coil when not in use, creating an eerie "snaking" movement.  
30 | Hollow-Skull Display: The user’s skull is partially transparent, revealing a live projection of their brain activity, often visualised as glowing neural circuits. Side Effect: The glowing lights shift colour when the user is angry, afraid, or excited, making it easy for others to read their emotions.
