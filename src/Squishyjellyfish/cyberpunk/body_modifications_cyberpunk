1 | Neural Accelerator: A cybernetic implant that increases cognitive speed, allowing for faster decision-making and split-second reactions. Side Effect: User experiences "data bleed" — random memories flash into their mind at inopportune moments.  
2 | Cybernetic Arm (Black-Market Edition): A full cyber-arm replacement with hidden compartments, taser fingertips, and foldable tools. Side Effect: Prone to "drift," where the arm moves on its own due to outdated firmware.  
3 | Optical Camouflage Skin: Skin laced with micro-camouflage nodes, allowing the user to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon. Side Effect: Camouflage can "flicker" under neon lights or during intense emotional states.  
4 | Smart-Eyes (Enhanced Optics): Advanced eyes that scan objects, detect threats, and display AR interfaces. Side Effect: Malfunctions can cause the AR interface to display "pop-up ads" during critical moments.  
5 | Retractable Finger Blades: Cybernetic fingers with extendable razor-sharp blades. Side Effect: Occasionally activates when the user gets too excited or anxious, leading to awkward social moments.  
6 | Subdermal Armour (Street-Level): Bullet-resistant layers under the skin, granting resistance to firearms and melee attacks. Side Effect: Reduced skin sensitivity makes it difficult to feel pain, heat, or light touches.  
7 | Spinal Reflex Enhancer: Enhances the user's reflexes, allowing them to dodge, counter, or react faster than normal. Side Effect: Users experience "phantom reflexes," twitching or flinching at perceived threats that aren't real.  
8 | Datajack (Neural Port): A port in the back of the skull for direct connections to networks, databases, or hacking rigs. Side Effect: Unsecured connections leave users vulnerable to "brain jacking" — remote hacking of their consciousness.  
9 | Combat Leg Implants: Cybernetic legs with advanced motors for superhuman jumping, sprinting, and kick-based combat. Side Effect: Tension build-up in the motors causes "leg lock," where movement is briefly frozen.  
10 | Vocal Modulator: Implant in the throat allowing for pitch control, mimicry, and voice encryption. Side Effect: Random voice "glitches" can make the user speak in different accents or robotic tones without warning.  
11 | Magnetic Grip Hands: Cybernetic palms with powerful magnetic control, allowing for climbing metal walls or gripping weapons tightly. Side Effect: Fingers sometimes "stick" to metal surfaces unexpectedly, causing awkward moments.  
12 | Brainwave Firewall: Mental security implant that blocks subliminal messaging, mind control, or "suggestion hacks." Side Effect: User experiences "feedback headaches" after extended exposure to advertisements or AR pop-ups.  
13 | Audio Enhancers (Cybernetic Ears): Advanced hearing upgrades that can filter noise, boost volume, and detect subsonic frequencies. Side Effect: High-pitched frequencies sometimes cause "audio overdrive," resulting in sudden deafness for 30 seconds.  
14 | Cybernetic Jaw (Steel-Bite): Jaw reinforced with cybernetic plates and enhanced teeth capable of biting through steel cables. Side Effect: User accidentally bites down too hard on food, breaking plates, mugs, and sometimes their own teeth.  
15 | Holo-Tattoo Skin: Body covered in holographic tattoos that can shift, animate, or display digital messages. Side Effect: Glitches cause random "advertisements" to flash on the user's skin for 30 seconds at random times.  
16 | Bloodstream Nanobots: Swarm of microscopic repair drones that repair wounds from the inside. Side Effect: User experiences "fever spikes" when nanobots overwork themselves, causing temporary overheating.  
17 | Cybernetic Spine (Reinforced): Reinforced spine that enhances balance, strength, and posture, allowing for carrying heavy loads. Side Effect: "Spinal lock" occurs when the user bends awkwardly, freezing them in place for 10 seconds.  
18 | Augmented Reality Overlay (Visual Implant): Allows users to see AR interfaces, chat messages, and digital signs in real time. Side Effect: Hackers can insert false messages or images, leading to paranoia.  
19 | Toxicity Filter (Cyber-Liver): An enhanced liver that processes alcohol, drugs, and toxins faster than normal. Side Effect: Some toxins remain "trapped" in the system, causing random moments of intoxication.  
20 | EMP Resistance (Body Shielding): Body coated with an anti-EMP shielding layer, protecting cybernetic implants from electrical surges. Side Effect: Static electricity builds up in the user's body, leading to small electric shocks when touching metal objects.  
21 | Synthetic Muscle Weave (Performance-Grade): Muscle fibres replaced with stronger synthetic strands, granting superhuman strength. Side Effect: Users sometimes tear their own muscles from overexertion, causing pain and temporary weakness.  
22 | Retractable Arm Cannon: A small ballistic weapon hidden inside a cybernetic forearm, activated on command. Side Effect: The weapon occasionally "ejects" unexpectedly, causing social embarrassment.  
23 | Subdermal Bio-Lights: Small glowing lights beneath the skin, often used for fashion or status. Side Effect: Bio-lights attract insects and glow faintly during sleep, making it hard to stay hidden.  
24 | Emotion Regulator (Mood Chip): A chip that regulates mood, controlling anxiety, aggression, or euphoria. Side Effect: Occasionally "overcorrects," leaving the user in an unnervingly calm state in life-threatening situations.  
25 | Bone Blades (Wrist-Mounted): Blades stored in the user's forearms, extending from the wrists. Side Effect: Users sometimes "snap" the blades too quickly, chipping or dulling them.  
26 | Infrared Vision (Eye Mod): Eyes upgraded with infrared vision, allowing the user to see heat signatures. Side Effect: Overuse causes the world to remain "red-tinted" for several minutes after deactivation.  
27 | Power Fist (Cybernetic Fist): A heavily modified fist capable of delivering concussive shockwaves on impact. Side Effect: Power surges in the system sometimes cause the fist to "punch on its own" when startled.  
28 | Biochemical Filters (Lung Mod): Filters in the lungs that block airborne toxins, smoke, and pathogens. Side Effect: Filter build-up causes shortness of breath until the filters are flushed.  
29 | Cloak Skin (Thermal Cloaking): Body mod that hides heat signatures and makes the user invisible to thermal cameras. Side Effect: If the cloaking fails, the body emits bursts of "heat waves
