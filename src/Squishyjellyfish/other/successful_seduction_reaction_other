    "0": "1 | A slow, warm smile spreads across their face, no longer teasing or uncertain, but entirely genuine. Their posture softens completely, their body naturally angling toward you, as if drawn by some unseen force. There’s no hesitation, no second-guessing—only a quiet acceptance that they’ve already given in, and they’re more than happy about it.",
    "1": "2 | Their breath steadies, their shoulders dropping as a relaxed ease settles over them. They tilt their head slightly, watching you with quiet admiration, as if finally allowing themselves to enjoy the moment. The resistance they once held is gone, replaced by something softer, something that welcomes whatever happens next.",
    "2": "3 | Their lips twitch into a slow smirk, but this time, there’s no challenge behind it—only interest, only invitation. Their weight shifts forward instinctively, as if the distance between you no longer matters. Their entire stance exudes warmth, an unspoken promise that you’ve not just won them over—you’ve captivated them.",
    "3": "4 | A quiet exhale, more like a sigh of relief than surrender, as if they’d been holding onto doubt for too long and are finally letting it go. Their stance relaxes fully, their body language completely open. Whatever had held them back is no longer important. They’re here, fully present, fully yours in this moment.",
    "4": "5 | A breath of amusement escapes them, followed by a soft shake of the head, as if they can’t believe how easily they’ve fallen under your spell. Their fingers flex slightly at their sides before stilling, their weight shifting forward in quiet acceptance. The moment is no longer about hesitation—only anticipation for what comes next.",
    "5": "6 | The teasing edge from before fades entirely, leaving only an easy, natural warmth in their gaze. Their expression softens, their lips parting slightly as they breathe you in, taking in the moment fully. Their entire stance radiates openness, an undeniable yes without the need for words.",
    "6": "7 | Their body language changes entirely, the last traces of restraint falling away as they settle into the moment. Their breath comes slow and even, their entire presence now steady, certain. There’s no more tension, no unspoken doubt—only quiet, eager willingness.",
    "7": "8 | A deep, slow inhale, followed by an even slower exhale, their entire body relaxing as they let themselves feel the moment. Their stance shifts closer, naturally, effortlessly, as if something invisible is pulling them in. There’s no question left in their mind anymore—they’ve decided, and their decision is clear.",
    "8": "9 | Their expression softens, their eyes lingering on you with a look that speaks louder than words. Their breath catches slightly before evening out, their lips parting as if about to say something—but they don’t. Instead, their body simply leans in, a quiet, instinctive movement that says everything: you’ve won them over, and they want this.",
    "9": "10 | A slow inhale, followed by an even slower exhale, their chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. Their gaze flickers over you, no longer calculating, no longer resisting, but expectant. The air between you is different now, heavier, charged. They’ve given in, but the decision of what comes next is entirely in your hands.",
    "10": "11 | Their lips part slightly, as if considering something they don’t voice. Their fingers trail lightly over their wrist, an absentminded gesture, before stilling completely. The distance between you is no longer a barrier—it’s an invitation, one that they’ve left entirely up to you.",
    "11": "12 | Their gaze lingers, heavier than before, their body subtly angling toward you as if drawn by something unseen. They aren’t moving away, aren’t resisting, but there’s still a quiet question in the way they hold themselves, a silent challenge to see if you’ll take control of what happens next.",
    "12": "13 | Their breath catches for a second, then evens out. Their fingers flex at their sides before stilling, their body no longer retreating, no longer tense. They’re waiting—letting you see just how far you’ll take this, letting themselves be swayed, but not without giving you the responsibility of steering it forward.",
    "13": "14 | A glance away, the smallest of hesitations, but then their focus returns to you, sharper now. Their arms lower, their weight shifting forward just slightly, subtle enough that it’s a choice rather than an accident. The last trace of uncertainty fades, replaced with something that lingers, something expectant. They’re in—but how far depends entirely on you.",
    "14": "15 | Their stance is different now, no longer defensive, no longer deflecting. Their fingers trail absently over a piece of jewellery, a sleeve, something tactile, but their focus is on you. Their breath comes slower, their posture easier. They’ve let you win—but they’re watching to see how you’ll handle victory.",
    "15": "16 | A slow shift, a roll of their shoulders, their body language settling into something smoother, something open. Their lips part slightly as if they might say something, but they don’t. Instead, they just stand there, watching, waiting. The ball is in your court now, and they seem content to let you play it.",
    "16": "17 | Their head tilts, amusement flickering in their expression, but it’s different now—softer, more thoughtful. Their arms drop to their sides, their stance open, no longer resisting, no longer testing. They’ve surrendered, but there’s something about the way they hold themselves that suggests they want to see how you handle their shift in willingness.",
    "17": "18 | Their fingers flex at their side before relaxing completely, the last bit of hesitation fading as their stance loosens. They exhale, slow and measured, as if settling into the moment. Their posture isn’t just open now—it’s inviting. They’ve let go of their restraint, but there’s still something unfinished in the way they wait.",
    "18": "19 | The way they shift, the slight lean toward you, the way their hands finally rest still at their sides—it all feels deliberate now, controlled. The resistance from earlier is gone, but they haven’t handed you everything yet. There’s still something unfinished, something that lingers, waiting to see if you’ll truly take control.",
    "19": "20 | The teasing smirk is gone now, replaced by something steadier, something less performative and more real. Their body language has shifted entirely—no hesitation, no resistance, only presence. The moment holds weight, but they aren’t the one carrying it anymore. They’ve given you what you wanted. Now, they’re waiting to see what you’ll do with it.",
    "20": "21 | Their lips twitch into something resembling a smirk, but it never quite forms. Instead, their expression lingers somewhere between amusement and hesitation. Their posture has loosened, but not completely. They’re intrigued, yes, but something holds them back. They haven’t said no—but they’re waiting for something more before they fully commit.",
    "21": "22 | A slow, steady breath, measured and careful, as if sorting through their own thoughts. Their stance remains open, but there’s something unreadable in their eyes, something uncertain. The tension from before is gone, but so is the certainty. They’ve given you a door, but they’re not stepping through it just yet. The next move has to be yours.",
    "22": "23 | Their weight shifts, their shoulders rolling back, but there’s no finality to it. Their body language suggests an internal debate, a quiet conflict they haven’t resolved. They aren’t pushing you away, but they aren’t pulling you in either. It’s a delicate balance, and whatever it is they’re waiting for, it’s something only you can provide.",
    "23": "24 | The smallest of movements—fingers grazing over a surface, a slight glance away—reveals their reluctance, but not rejection. They aren’t against this, they aren’t resisting, but something holds them back from letting go entirely. They remain in the moment, invested, but you get the feeling you haven’t won everything just yet.",
    "24": "25 | A long exhale, slow and deliberate. Their posture has changed, no longer tense, no longer distant, but they aren’t leaning in either. Their breath comes measured, their expression calm, but not yielding. You’ve gotten their interest, but they’re testing to see if you can keep it. The game isn’t over.",
    "25": "26 | Their fingers brush idly against their wrist, an absentminded movement, but their stance doesn’t shift forward. They’re still considering something, still weighing the moment between interest and restraint. You’ve got them listening, but not convinced. Not yet. The work isn’t done, and neither is the chase.",
    "26": "27 | A quiet sigh, their head tilting slightly as they study you, as if trying to decide if what’s happening is real, if it’s worth the risk. They aren’t resisting anymore, but something holds them back from fully surrendering. They’re interested, but something inside them needs a little more convincing before they let this happen.",
    "27": "28 | The tension is gone from their posture, but there’s still something unreadable behind their gaze, something careful. They’re engaged, receptive, but hesitant. The space between you feels balanced on the edge of something—an understanding, an expectation. They’re waiting, but for what? That’s up to you to find out.",
    "28": "29 | A moment of silence, stretching longer than it should, before their body language shifts. It’s small, almost imperceptible—the way their fingers stop fidgeting, the way their shoulders ease. They’ve accepted something, but not everything. The door is open, but they haven’t stepped through. If you want more, you’ll have to reach for it.",
    "29": "30 | The smirk that had been teasing before is gone, replaced with something softer, something thoughtful. There’s no resistance now, but no surrender either. It’s a strange in-between, an unspoken challenge. They aren’t stopping you. They aren’t pulling away. But they’re also not making it easy. They need more. The next move is yours.",
    "30": "31 | A slow, deliberate blink, their gaze dragging over you with quiet consideration. There’s no tension in their stance anymore, no immediate rejection, but something still lingers beneath the surface—an internal debate they haven’t quite resolved. They’re listening, watching, interested. But something tells you they need just a little more before they fully give in.",
    "31": "32 | Their arms uncross, the last remnants of resistance fading from their posture, but their weight remains evenly distributed—neutral, unreadable. There’s a pause, a hesitation that feels less like uncertainty and more like waiting. They aren’t going to fight this, but they aren’t handing you everything either. The moment is yours to shape.",
    "32": "33 | A breath catches at the back of their throat before they recover, smoothing it into something controlled. Their hands twitch as if resisting the urge to reach for something—or someone. Their gaze flickers to you, assessing, considering. They’ve let you in, but they haven’t let you have them yet.",
    "33": "34 | A quiet exhale, their fingers pressing briefly against the back of their hand before they still. There’s no fight left in them, no challenge, but there’s something else—a waiting, a curiosity. They’ve given you space, an opening, but they aren’t chasing. If you want more, it’s yours to claim—but only if you push further.",
    "34": "35 | A shift in weight, the smallest roll of their shoulders, as if they’re settling into something they hadn’t expected. There’s no resistance in their body, no tension in their stance. But they’re still watching you, waiting to see what you’ll do with the ground you’ve gained. The game isn’t over—it’s just begun.",
    "35": "36 | Their body language has changed, subtle but unmistakable. Shoulders dropped, arms loose at their sides, but their expression still carries something unreadable. They’ve accepted this, whatever this is, but there’s still something they aren’t quite giving up. They’re open, but not unguarded. If you want more, you’ll have to prove it’s worth it.",
    "36": "37 | A slow inhale, the rise and fall of their chest more noticeable now, more measured. They’ve settled, made peace with the direction things are going, but they’re not moving any further on their own. The tension is gone, but so is the urgency. It’s up to you now—to push, to pull, to find what still holds them back.",
    "37": "38 | Their fingers graze the edge of their sleeve, an absent-minded movement, but the way they look at you now is anything but distracted. Their body has turned toward you, receptive but not yielding. They aren’t walking away, but they aren’t stepping forward either. They’ve given you space to take the lead—if you dare.",
    "38": "39 | The teasing edge is gone, replaced with something quieter, something unreadable. There’s a shift in the air between you, something that feels heavier than before. They aren’t resisting, but they also aren’t fully yours yet. They’ve let you get this far, but they’re still waiting to see if you can take them the rest of the way.",
    "39": "40 | Their entire posture shifts, any lingering tension melting away as they fully embrace the moment. Their breath steadies into a slow, relaxed rhythm, and their stance angles effortlessly toward you. There is no more doubt, no hesitation—only certainty. The way they carry themselves now is unmistakable; they aren’t just open to this, they want it. Any barriers that once stood between you have crumbled completely, leaving nothing but anticipation for what happens next.",
    "40": "41 | A slow, measured breath, as if savouring the moment before fully giving in. Their posture softens entirely, their body language completely open now. Any lingering hesitation has melted away, replaced by something steady, something certain. There’s no need for any further persuasion—this is no longer a game of winning them over. They’re already yours.",
    "41": "42 | A quiet exhale, a subtle shift forward, the kind of movement that speaks volumes without needing words. The teasing, the testing, the hesitation—it’s all gone now. Their weight leans toward you, their stance relaxed, their presence heavy with certainty. They aren’t waiting for another move. They’ve already made their decision.",
    "42": "43 | The sharp, playful glint in their eyes fades into something deeper, something more settled. There’s no more restraint, no unreadable hesitations. Their breath is slower now, their body completely at ease, as if they’d been holding onto some last defence but have now chosen to let it go. They’ve given in fully, with no question of turning back.",
    "43": "44 | The teasing smirk that once held a layer of resistance is gone, replaced with something softer, something undeniably real. Their body language is unguarded, their stance open, their attention fully on you. There’s no more waiting, no more games, just complete surrender to the moment.",
    "44": "45 | A slow tilt of the head, a subtle shift closer, as if instinct has taken over. Their breath comes quieter, more controlled, but there’s no doubt in their presence anymore. They aren’t waiting for another push, another test. They’re here, fully, completely, with nothing left to question.",
    "45": "46 | A long breath, the rise and fall of their chest steady, no longer measured with hesitation. Their body has relaxed entirely, their stance angled toward you, fully present. There’s no more teasing, no more uncertainty—just the weight of a decision they’ve already made. They aren’t holding back anymore.",
    "46": "47 | Their weight shifts, this time with complete certainty, their body now in sync with their decision. No second-guessing, no careful calculations—just pure willingness. They are here, and they want you to know it. They have given themselves over completely, with no doubt left in their movements.",
    "47": "48 | Their expression softens, lips slightly parted, a slow breath escaping as they settle into the space between you. There’s no hesitation left, no unfinished thoughts or lingering doubts. They are entirely present in this moment, fully giving in to whatever happens next.",
    "48": "49 | A glance over you, slower this time, not calculating but savouring. Their body is completely relaxed now, no tension, no resistance. The shift in their posture is unmistakable—they’ve accepted this, wanted this, and now they’re waiting, but not because they are uncertain. They are ready.",
    "49": "50 | The teasing, the games, the push and pull—it’s all gone. There is no battle to be won anymore, no barriers left standing. Their entire stance, their entire presence, radiates one simple truth: they’ve given in completely. There is nothing more you need to do. The moment is entirely yours."
