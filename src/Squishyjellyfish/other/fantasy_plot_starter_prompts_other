    "0": "1 | The Missing Caravan: A wealthy merchant lord pays handsomely for reliable couriers to escort his caravans across the King’s Road, but his latest shipment—a convoy of ten wagons—has vanished without a trace. The route was well-travelled and safe, patrolled regularly by local guards, with no recent reports of banditry. When you ride along the path, you find one of the merchant’s banners torn and hanging from a tree, but there are no tracks, no wreckage, no bloodstains—nothing to suggest an attack. Stranger still, some claim to have heard distant echoes of wagon wheels and horses in the night, but when they look… there’s only empty road.",
    "1": "2 | The Village That No Longer Exists: A lone rider arrives at a bustling market town, half-starved and panicked, claiming to have come from Branwick, a village just two days’ ride away. But when the locals hear the name, they exchange nervous glances. Branwick has been abandoned for over a century, lost to a plague that wiped out its people. No one has lived there for generations. The rider refuses to believe it, insisting, \"I left my family there yesterday!\" When you travel to Branwick’s location, you find nothing but overgrown ruins, the remains of crumbling homes overtaken by vines. Yet, as the sun sets, you spot fresh smoke rising from unseen chimneys, and the sound of children laughing drifts through the air.",
    "2": "3 | The Lost Heir: A dying noble grasps your wrist, his breath weak as he utters his final words: \"My child… still lives.\" It should be impossible. His only heir was declared dead twenty years ago, lost at sea when their ship was claimed by a storm. The noble’s enemies, eager to claim his lands, dismiss his words as the ramblings of a man at death’s door. Yet, a few loyal retainers whisper of a secret exile, a child who may have been spirited away under the cover of night. There is a reward for finding them… but there is also a bounty for ensuring they never return.",
    "3": "4 | The Witch’s Debt: For decades, the people of Briar Hollow have lived under the quiet",
    "4": "protection of Madame Elwynn, an old herbalist who resides in the forest, known for healing the sick and warding off misfortune. But now, the healer is dying, and as she weakly takes your hand, she whispers: \"I never repaid my debt.\" The next morning, a thick fog rolls over the village, and the air grows cold despite the summer heat. Cattle refuse to leave their pens, children wake screaming of dark figures at their windows, and something begins scratching at doors after nightfall. The village elder warns that whatever protected this town for so long has come to collect… and it will not be denied.",
    "5": "5 | The Haunted Battlefield: The fog-choked valley of Thornmere was once the site of a great and terrible battle, where thousands fell in a single day. The war ended, the victors claimed their spoils, and the dead were left to rot—unburied, unhonoured. For decades, the valley has been avoided, its ground soaked in old blood, and no traveller dares cross it. But the land itself remembers. Every year, on the anniversary of the battle, the valley comes alive once more, and the war begins again. Spectral soldiers rise in the mist, locked in an endless cycle of violence, cutting down any who wander into their domain. The local lord has put out a lucrative contract: find the source of the curse, break it… or be ready to fight the dead.",
    "6": "6 | The Poisoned Well: The village of Redbrook sits beside a crystal-clear stream, a lifeline that has sustained them for generations. But one week ago, the water turned black overnight, thick as ink, clinging to the skin like oil. Within days, the crops began to wither, livestock fell sick, and the people—desperate for water—vanished one by one. The village priest claims it is a curse, punishment for breaking an ancient pact, while the town’s elder swears it is something worse. No one can agree on what changed, only that the sickness began after a band of travellers stopped by the well one night… and were never seen again.",
    "7": "7 | The Silent Forest: For as long as anyone can remember, the Duskwind Forest has been alive with the calls of birds, the chatter of insects, and the rustling of unseen creatures moving through the undergrowth. That is, until last week. Now, the woods have fallen deathly silent—no birds, no wind, no sound at all. Hunters returning from the deep woods say their own footsteps feel muffled, as if the very air is swallowing sound. Worse still, those who venture too far claim that the trees have moved—shifting slightly when no one is looking, closing off paths that once existed. Some never return at all. The local village chieftain is willing to pay for answers, but the oldest members of the village warn you: \"The forest has decided it no longer wishes to be disturbed.\"",
    "8": "8 | The Old Baron’s Will: For decades, the infamous Baron of Greystone Keep ruled with an iron grip, his name whispered in fear across the land. He amassed a vast fortune, rumoured to be hidden within his crumbling castle. But now, the baron is dead—and his last will and testament is missing. His remaining heirs, along with cutthroat treasure hunters and thieves, are racing to uncover his final secrets. Some say he had no fortune at all, that his true wealth was knowledge too dangerous to be spoken. Yet, those who enter Greystone Keep to search for clues report hearing the baron’s laughter echoing in the halls at night, though the castle has been empty for years.",
    "9": "9 | The Stolen Relic: The Grand Temple of Everlight, a sanctuary known for its divine blessings, has been robbed in the dead of night. The temple’s most sacred artefact, a crystal known as the Heart of Aelora, has vanished from its pedestal without a trace. The high priests insist that the relic is not just a symbol of faith—it is the source of the temple’s divine protection. Already, the air inside feels colder, and strange shadows flicker where none should exist. Witnesses claim to have seen a hooded figure carrying something glowing through the city streets, but their tracks lead only to an alleyway where the walls are blackened, as if seared by fire. With the temple’s power weakening, what might creep into the city now that its guardian is gone?",
    "10": "10 | The Cursed Ring: A desperate noble bursts into the town square, seeking a healer, a priest—anyone who can break a curse. His young daughter has been bedridden for weeks, her once-bright eyes now dull and glassy, her breath shallow. No medicine has helped, no prayer has lifted the sickness. The only clue? A silver ring wrapped around her finger, a recent gift from an unknown sender. She refuses to remove it, gripping it so tightly that her nails have drawn blood. At night, the servants report whispers drifting from her chamber—but when they enter, the girl is always alone, staring at the ceiling with a vacant smile.",
    "11": "11 | The River Runs Red: A normally peaceful river that supplies nearby villages with fresh water has begun running red, thick as blood. The local farmers believe it to be an omen of war, while the temple priests claim it is a punishment from the gods. Yet, when examined, the water is not blood at all, but something thicker, darker, something that does not dilute or fade. Fishermen who have touched it in their nets complain of strange dreams—visions of a great beast thrashing beneath the waves, its eyes filled with hunger. Worse still, those who drink from the river vanish before dawn, leaving only their empty clothes and footprints leading into the water.",
    "12": "12 | The Abandoned Farmstead: A modest farmstead sits on the outskirts of town, its fields overgrown, its animals wandering loose. The villagers say the family that lived there was happy, hardworking—until they weren’t. One morning, a neighbour arrived to trade goods, only to find the door hanging open, food still warm on the table. The family was simply gone. No signs of a struggle, no packed belongings—as if they had stepped outside and never returned. Stranger still, at night, villagers report seeing the glow of a lantern moving from room to room. Some swear they hear laughter—but when morning comes, the house is silent once more.",
    "13": "13 | The Merchant’s Riddle: A mysterious travelling merchant arrives in the city, setting up a grand display in the market square. Among his many exotic wares, one item draws the most attention—a locked chest, covered in strange runes. The merchant announces that the chest holds a treasure beyond imagination, but there is no key. Instead, he offers a challenge: \"The key is in the words. Solve the riddle, and it is yours.\" Many have tried; all have failed. The last person who attempted the riddle left muttering nonsense, their eyes vacant with madness.",
    "14": "14 | The Highwayman’s Warning: A notorious highwayman has been ambushing travellers along the King’s Road—but unlike most bandits, he never takes gold, jewels, or valuables. Instead, he demands a secret. Each person must whisper something unknown to the world, and only then does he let them pass. Some have tried to lie—they were found days later, still alive, but unable to speak. Recently, one merchant refused altogether, calling the bandit a fraud. His body was found a week later, slumped against a tree—his mouth sewn shut with golden thread.",
    "15": "15 | The Sleeping Lord: Lord Edric Vael, a noble of great wealth and influence, has fallen into an unnatural sleep. No amount of shaking, medicine, or magic can wake him. His wife insists that on the night before he collapsed, she saw a pale figure standing at the window, watching him. The servants whisper of an old family curse, one that doomed his ancestors to the same fate. In the weeks since, the lord has not aged a day, and his breath remains steady—but when the maids clean his chambers, they find his fingernails growing unnaturally long, curling like claws.",
    "16": "16 | The Fading Town: The people of Harrow’s Rest are panicking. Not because of war, plague, or monsters—but because their town is disappearing. Not physically—not yet. It began with small things: a missing signpost, a house that people swore stood there last week. But now, it has spread. Names are vanishing from gravestones, and family members no longer recognise each other. Old records show that Harrow’s Rest has existed for centuries, yet travellers and merchants swear they’ve never heard of it before. And now, on the town’s edge, buildings flicker in and out of existence.",
    "17": "17 | The Burning Lights: Every full moon, eerie blue flames appear atop the cliffs of a coastal village. At first, the villagers dismissed it as a strange weather phenomenon—until the flames began to move. Slowly, deliberately, they creep closer to the village each time, appearing in new places, as if they are watching. Last night, one of the lights appeared inside a fisherman’s home. His house is now a charred ruin, and he is nowhere to be found.",
    "18": "18 | The Pact of Ravens: A mysterious old woman sits in the village square every day, surrounded by hundreds of black ravens. She speaks to them in a language no one recognises, and when asked, she only smiles and says, \"They are listening.\" Over the past few weeks, the birds have grown bolder—perching on windowsills, following children home, pecking at locked doors. Last night, the mayor was woken by a soft tapping at his bedroom window. It wasn’t the wind. It was a single raven, holding a key in its beak.",
    "19": "19 | The Drowned Bell: Fishermen from a coastal village swear they have heard a great bell tolling beneath the waves, though there is no shipwreck nearby. At first, it was a curiosity—but now, every sailor who has heard it has reported strange dreams. Some dream of great shadowy figures moving beneath the sea, others of hands pulling at their ankles as they sleep. And last night, a ship washed ashore, crewless, its mast tangled with seaweed that does not belong to these waters.",
    "20": "20 | The Stone Giant’s Tears: A massive stone statue of a forgotten warrior stands at the entrance of a valley, a relic from an ancient war. Recently, water has begun seeping from its eyes, though the sky has been clear for months. Some believe it is a warning. Others believe the giant has woken.",
    "21": "21 | The Stranger in the Corner: The Hearth & Horn is packed tonight, the air thick with the scent of roasting meat, spilled ale, and damp wool. The fire crackles merrily, yet despite the lively chatter, one figure sits alone in the farthest corner of the tavern. Cloaked in black and silver, their hood pulled low, they stir their drink without ever taking a sip. The barmaid, pale-faced, warns you under her breath, \"No one saw them come in. No one saw them order. But they’ve been sitting there for hours… just waiting.\" Then, just as you glance back at the figure, their hand lifts from the table, revealing a single gold coin—a foreign mint, unlike anything you’ve ever seen. They slide it toward you and whisper, \"I need someone… who doesn’t ask questions.\"",
    "22": "22 | The Note Beneath Your Mug: As you settle in with your drink, enjoying the hum of the Rowan’s Rest Inn, you notice something odd—a folded scrap of parchment tucked beneath your mug. The ink is fresh, the writing sharp and precise: \"Meet me in the stables at midnight. Come alone.\" Glancing around, no one seems to be watching, but the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. You could ignore it, tear it up, and move on. But something tells you that whoever left it knew exactly who you are… and why you might be tempted to see what they have to say.",
    "23": "23 | The Bard’s Cursed Ballad: The minstrel’s voice carries through the smoky tavern, weaving a tale of tragedy and longing. The crowd listens, enraptured, but as the song nears its end, the bard’s fingers falter on the lute strings.Their face twists in pain, and they double over, gasping. The innkeeper rushes forward, but the bard snaps their head up, wild-eyed, grabbing your wrist. \"You—you have to finish it!\" they rasp. \"The song—the ending—I was never supposed to sing it!\" Then, before you can react, they slump forward—unconscious, or worse.",
    "24": "24 | The Tavern That Shouldn’t Be There: The rain is relentless, hammering against the road as the wind howls through the trees. Just as the cold begins to seep into your bones, you spot a lantern flickering in the dark—a tavern, standing alone on the roadside. The sign sways in the wind: The Hollow Stag. But… you’ve travelled this road before. This tavern wasn’t here yesterday. Inside, the warmth is inviting, the ale rich, the fire crackling. The patrons are friendly, if a little pale, their laughter strangely distant, like echoes through water. As you settle in, the innkeeper leans close, whispering with a knowing smile: \"Best drink up. You only get one night here.\"",
    "25": "25 | A Drinking Bet That Goes Too Far: A rowdy group of mercenaries is celebrating at the Broken Tankard, their mugs sloshing with ale as they challenge each other to impossible dares. Eventually, one turns to you, a wild grin splitting their scarred face. \"Your turn! I wager fifty gold you won’t go down into the old cellar!\" The crowd erupts in laughter, but the innkeeper’s expression darkens. \"Enough of that,\" he growls. \"No one goes down there.\" But now, curiosity has sunk its claws into you. As the night wears on, you notice something strange—not a single servant ever fetches anything from below. No barrels, no crates, no footsteps on the stairs. What’s down there… and why is the innkeeper so desperate to pretend it doesn’t exist?",
    "26": "26 | The Unfinished Drink: A lone man sits at the bar, his back to the crowd, a half-full mug before him. The barmaid sighs as she wipes the counter, muttering, \"That one’s been there all night, hasn’t touched his drink.\" You glance at him—his clothes are wet, his boots caked in mud, and his hands… shaking. When you finally speak, he startles, looking up with hollow eyes. \"It followed me here,\" he whispers. \"I thought I lost it. But it’s outside. Watching.\" A gust of wind rattles the shutters, and for a moment, you swear you see a shadow move just beyond the candlelight.",
    "27": "27 | The Ghost at the Hearth: The fire in the Tumbledown Inn is warm, the ale flows freely, and the night is lively with music and chatter. But something feels… off. You can’t shake the feeling that someone is watching you. Then, as you turn your head toward the fireplace, you see her. A woman, dressed in fine, old-fashioned clothes, sitting by the hearth with a faint smile. She lifts her cup in a silent toast… then vanishes in the blink of an eye. The bartender sees you staring and sighs. \"Aye, she does that. Best not to acknowledge her—last one who did woke up in her grave.\"",
    "28": "28 | The Sleeping Knight: A massive warrior sits slumped at the back of the tavern, his heavy cloak draped over the table, his face hidden beneath a rusted helm. The barkeep warns you not to disturb him—he’s been there for days, hasn’t moved an inch, hasn’t eaten or drunk a thing. But then, as the clock strikes midnight, his fingers twitch. His head lifts just slightly, and in a voice like grinding stone, he murmurs, \"It’s almost time.\"",
    "29": "29 | The Tavern With No Name: You push open the door to the tavern, expecting the usual warmth of fire and ale, but something is… wrong. The sign outside was blank. The walls inside are bare, no decorations, no paintings, no crests. The patrons drink in absolute silence, eyes never meeting, movements precise and rehearsed, as if they are all part of some unspoken ritual. The barkeep watches you with an unreadable expression. When you finally gather the courage to ask what the place is called, he simply says, \"It’s whatever you need it to be.\"",
    "30": "30 | The Man Who Knew Too Much: A thin, nervous-looking scholar sits in the farthest booth, muttering to himself and scribbling furiously in a leather-bound book. His drink sits untouched, his eyes darting to the door every few moments. When you pass by, he grabs your wrist with an iron grip. \"They’re listening,\" he hisses. \"They know I’ve figured it out.\" He shoves a folded parchment into your hand, eyes wild with fear. \"Read it. Burn it. Then get out before they see you with it.\" Before you can respond, the tavern door creaks open… and the scholar goes deathly still.",
    "31": "31 | The King’s Missing Letter: A royal courier is found dead in a back alley, their body still warm, yet their satchel completely empty. The city guard writes it off as a common mugging, but the victim’s boots are too fine, their belt too rich—this was no ordinary traveller. A noble discreetly approaches you with a hushed request: \"The king sent a letter last night—one that could change everything. It never reached its destination.\" No one knows what the message contained, but already, rumours swirl in the royal court. Some whisper that the king was about to name an heir. Others claim it was a declaration of war. But if the message was stolen… who now holds its power?",
    "32": "32 | The Banished Prince’s Return: Ten years ago, the youngest prince of the kingdom was exiled for treason, stripped of his title and sent into the wilderness to die alone. Yet now, whispers spread through the city: he is back. Some claim to have seen him in the slums, rallying the desperate. Others say he’s moving among the noble houses, seeking allies in secret. But there’s one undeniable truth—the throne is vulnerable. If the prince is truly alive, he either wants justice… or revenge.",
    "33": "33 | The Queen’s Secret Affair: A noblewoman approaches you in secret, her face pale, her hands trembling. She presses a sealed letter into your palm. \"Deliver this to the queen,\" she whispers. \"It concerns her… private affairs.\" The palace is a web of spies and whispers, and if the letter is discovered, heads will roll. Some say the queen has a hidden lover, one whose name could bring ruin to the crown. But others suggest something even worse—that this is no lover’s scandal, but treason. And once you hold the letter, you are now part of the game.",
    "34": "34 | A Poison in the Wine: At a grand banquet, nobles and dignitaries raise their goblets in a toast, celebrating a new treaty between rival factions. The moment the glasses touch lips, one noble falls to the floor, convulsing—dead before he even hits the ground. Panic spreads, accusations fly, and the treaty is moments from collapsing. The poisoner is still in the room, blending in with the crowd. You have only minutes before the guards start rounding up suspects—and you are among them.",
    "35": "35 | The Chancellor’s Blackmail: A powerful chancellor is losing control of the court. Rumours swirl that someone has uncovered his greatest secret—one that, if revealed, would see him hanged for treason. In desperation, he hires you to find the blackmailer and silence them, permanently. The payment is generous, but you quickly learn something disturbing: the blackmailer is not asking for gold. Instead, they are manipulating events, nudging laws, whispering ideas into the ears of powerful nobles. And worse yet, the chancellor seems more afraid of what he did… than of dying.",
    "36": "36 | The Noble Who Knows Too Much: A noble of great wealth and status has suddenly locked themselves away, refusing visitors, ignoring all political affairs. Servants whisper that they haven’t eaten in days, that they spend the nights muttering in the dark, jumping at shadows. Then, a single letter arrives in your hands, scrawled in shaking ink: \"I know what they did. I know the truth. Gods help me, I know too much.\" By morning, the noble is dead, and the city guard rules it a suicide. But the letter in your hand suggests otherwise.",
    "37": "37 | The Assassin’s Bargain: You’re approached by a man in pristine noble garb, his voice smooth, his manner calm. He sets a bag of gold before you and speaks plainly. \"A certain duke has become a problem. I want them removed—quietly.\" It’s a simple job, but something about the noble’s politeness feels off. Then you hear a different rumour—that a bounty has just been placed on the noble who hired you. Someone wants them dead before they can hire an assassin.",
    "38": "38 | The Crown’s Hidden Bastard: A secret long buried is about to surface—the king has an illegitimate child. If this child is found, it could shatter the royal bloodline, throwing the entire kingdom into chaos. A desperate noblewoman hires you with a warning: \"You must find them before the assassins do.\" The child is now an adult, completely unaware of their birthright, hidden among commoners, living an ordinary life. Do they deserve to be dragged into the bloody world of politics? And worse… what if they don’t want to be found?",
    "39": "39 | A Duel at Dawn: The capital is buzzing with scandal—a high-ranking noble has challenged another to a duel, one that will be settled at dawn. The fight is meant to be fair, but already, there are whispers of poisoned blades, sabotaged weapons, hidden archers waiting in the trees. One noble’s family hires you to ensure their champion wins, by any means necessary. The other side offers you double to see their rival fall instead. And then there’s a third option—the queen’s own spymaster, who asks, \"What if neither of them leave the duel alive?\"",
    "40": "40 | The Heir’s Sudden Death: The heir to the throne has died suddenly in their sleep. No signs of struggle, no wounds, no illness—just… gone. The royal family grieves, but not all are convinced it was natural. You are discreetly hired to investigate the cause, but the deeper you dig, the stranger the case becomes. Servants whisper that the heir had started acting strangely in their final days, speaking in odd tongues, writing notes they didn’t remember writing. Worse still, the royal physician is nowhere to be found.",
    "41": "41 | The War That Shouldn’t Happen: Tensions between two rival kingdoms are reaching their breaking point. The ruling lords are stubborn, proud, unwilling to negotiate. A secretive diplomat approaches you with a dangerous task: \"War is inevitable—unless we make it… inconvenient.\" They need you to sabotage key supply lines, expose forgeries planted by war-hungry nobles, and ensure that when the time comes, neither kingdom has the strength to raise their swords. If you succeed, war will be delayed or even avoided. If you fail, you’ll be labeled a traitor in two kingdoms.",
    "42": "42 | The Disappearing Ambassador: An ambassador from a foreign kingdom was meant to arrive last night to negotiate a fragile peace treaty. They never made it to the palace. Their guards were found dead on the road, their carriage overturned, but no sign of the diplomat. Some believe they were taken by enemies of the crown, others suspect they staged their own disappearance—but one thing is clear: if they aren’t found soon, the peace talks will collapse.",
    "43": "43 | The Merchant Guild’s Blackmail: A powerful merchant guild is under siege—not from war, but from a single unknown blackmailer. They have damning evidence of corruption, of smuggling, of treasonous trade with the enemy. The merchants are desperate to uncover their enemy’s identity before their empire crumbles. But the more you investigate, the clearer it becomes—this isn’t blackmail. It’s revenge.",
    "44": "44 | The Law No One Wants: The king is set to pass a new law—one that will change everything. But before the ink dries, someone wants it stopped. A noble hires you to steal the documents before they can be signed, ensuring that the law never takes effect. But another faction offers triple the payment to guarantee it does. Meanwhile, a third group warns you, \"The real danger isn’t the law. It’s the secret written between the lines.\"",
    "45": "45 | The Midnight Council: The palace has many chambers, but one door remains locked to all but a chosen few. Inside, the most powerful figures in the kingdom meet in secret. No minutes are kept. No records exist. Yet somehow, you’ve received an invitation. \"Come alone. Come unarmed. Do not speak unless spoken to.\" What they offer is a seat at their table… and a price you may not want to pay.",
    "46": "46 | The Sunken City Rises: In the heart of the Emerald Bay, where fishermen cast their nets and merchant ships sail freely, something stirs beneath the waves. For centuries, old legends spoke of a lost city—an ancient kingdom swallowed by the sea after angering the gods. Few took it seriously—until yesterday. A massive structure has breached the surface—a temple, barnacle-encrusted and reeking of salt and rot. The local governor has placed a royal bounty on whoever dares to explore its depths, but the fishermen refuse to go near it. \"It wasn't supposed to come back,\" an elder warns. \"Something down there still remembers.\"",
    "47": "47 | The Beast of Hollow Fen: The swamp known as Hollow Fen has always been a treacherous place—its murky waters thick with sinkholes, its fog-covered paths eaten away by decay. But now, something hunts within. Villagers whisper of a monstrous shape glimpsed in the mist, its eyes like burning coals, its breath thick with rot. It snatches cattle, drags grown men from their boats, and leaves nothing but splintered bones. The local baron offers a hefty reward for its head, but no one who has gone looking has ever returned.",
    "48": "48 | The Last Lighthouse Keeper: Atop the jagged cliffs of Blackshore, a lonely lighthouse once guided ships safely through the deadly currents. But the beacon went dark weeks ago, and wrecks now litter the coast. No one has seen the lighthouse keeper since, and when a group of sailors went to investigate, they found the lighthouse doors torn from their hinges. Inside, the walls were covered in symbols, scrawled in a shaking hand. A single word was repeated over and over: \"LISTEN.\"",
    "49": "49 | The Merchant and the Shattered Compass: A frantic merchant bursts into the inn, slamming a gold-plated compass onto the table. \"It’s broken!\" he exclaims, though it looks perfectly intact. He swears it always pointed true north—until yesterday, when the needle began spinning wildly. Now, no matter where he goes, the compass pulls toward a single direction—a place that doesn’t exist on any map. He offers half his fortune to anyone who will follow it and find out what lies at the end.",
    "50": "50 | The Sealed Door in the Mountain: High in the Stormcrag Mountains, where only the bravest climbers dare tread, a recent landslide has unearthed something strange—a massive stone door, seamlessly fitted into the rock face, with no visible handle or keyhole. Carved into the stone are hundreds of names, some long forgotten, others belonging to people who are still alive. At the bottom, a message reads: \"One must be erased for another to enter.\"",
    "51": "51 | The Cursed Fortune Teller: The travelling fortune teller known as Madame Veyna has vanished, leaving behind nothing but her ornate tarot deck, scattered across the ground in a ruined marketplace. Those who pick up the cards find themselves cursed by visions—fragments of a future that hasn’t happened yet. Some see their own deaths, others witness unfamiliar places, but all have one thing in common—the same shadowy figure lurking in the background of every vision. And last night, one of those cursed vanished without a trace.",
    "52": "52 | The Village That Only Appears at Dawn: At the break of dawn, just as the mist begins to lift from the rolling hills of Elmstead, an entire village appears where there was nothing the night before. The thatched-roof cottages look old yet well-kept, smoke rises from chimneys, and the scent of baking bread fills the air. But as the sun rises higher, the buildings fade, vanishing like mirages. No roads lead to it, no maps record its existence. Those who have tried to stay through sunrise were never seen again.",
    "53": "53 | The Dead Man Who Walked Home: A man who drowned in the river weeks ago walked into the village yesterday. He did not speak, his clothes still soaked, his skin pale and clammy. He simply stood in the village square, staring toward the house he once called home. When his wife approached him, he collapsed, lifeless once more. But clutched in his hand was a scroll sealed with wax—an official decree from the king. It was dated two days from now.",
    "54": "54 | The Unfinished Map: A renowned cartographer died in their sleep, slumped over their desk, pen still in hand. Laid out before them was an unfinished map, the ink still drying. It depicts a detailed coastline, intricate and precise—except for one section, hastily sketched in with shaking lines, an island that shouldn’t exist. In the margin, one final note: \"I saw it with my own eyes. Gods help me, it’s real.\"",
    "55": "55 | The Well That Whispers: In the middle of a quiet, forgotten hamlet, an ancient well whispers at night. The villagers claim to hear voices drifting up from the depths, calling to them by name, promising secrets, fortunes, and lost knowledge. A few villagers have climbed down to listen closer. None of them have come back. But last night, the whispers changed. They no longer call to the villagers. They call for you.",
    "56": "56 | The Village Locked in Time: Travellers passing through Lowmere Valley report a village where nothing ever changes—the same people, the same routines, the same conversations, repeated day after day. The villagers insist “It has always been this way”, their smiles never faltering. Last week, a wandering scholar stayed overnight to investigate, leaving detailed notes. The next day, he was gone, and in his place stood a new villager—one who looked eerily familiar, wearing the scholar’s boots and carrying his satchel. When questioned, he only smiled and said, “It has always been this way.”",
    "57": "57 | The Statue That Cries at Midnight: The towering statue of a weeping maiden has stood in the town square for centuries, a relic of an age long past. But last night, for the first time, the statue wept real tears. The water glistened in the moonlight, pooling at its base. This morning, the mayor was found drowned in his bed—his lungs filled with water, though there was no sign of struggle. The villagers are afraid. They believe the statue is mourning someone… or warning them.",
    "58": "58 | The Lone Survivor: A lone figure stumbles into town, half-starved, covered in grime, barely able to stand. He was part of an expedition to an ancient ruin in the Frozen Wastes. His team of twenty skilled adventurers had set out four months ago. When asked what happened, his voice trembles as he says: \"They’re still there… but they’re not the same anymore.\"",
    "59": "59 | The Strange Footprints: At dawn, massive footprints appeared in the fields outside the village—deep, wide, heavier than any known beast. They start at the forest’s edge and end suddenly in the middle of an open clearing, as if whatever made them had simply… vanished. The village elder warns that these tracks are not the first, and the last time they appeared, an entire household vanished overnight.",
    "60": "60 | The Golden Stag: Hunters speak of a stag with golden antlers, a creature of legend that has not been seen in over a century. It is said that whoever catches it will be granted a single wish, but to kill it is to invite ruin. Yesterday, the stag was seen just beyond the tree line. A powerful noble has placed a massive bounty on its head, but the old hunters warn: \"The last man who shot at the stag was never seen again. Only his bow was found, turned to solid gold.\"",
    "61": "61 | The Unmarked Road: A merchant caravan arrives in town speaking of a road that shouldn’t exist—a cobbled path, overgrown with moss, branching off the main trade route where no road had ever been before. The caravan master, curious, sent a scout to follow it. He returned an hour later, pale and shaking, refusing to speak of what he saw. That night, he vanished, leaving behind only his boots and a map hastily scribbled with a single word—\"Tomorrow.\" Now, the merchant offers a fortune in gold to anyone willing to follow the road and see where it leads.",
    "62": "62 | The Empty Throne of Varroth: The mountain stronghold of Varroth, once the seat of a mighty kingdom, has stood abandoned for over a century, its halls sealed, its treasures left untouched. No one knows why the Varrothi fled overnight, leaving behind weapons still racked, meals still set at long tables, armour still polished as if waiting for war. Now, the great gates have creaked open on their own, and torches within have begun to flicker alight, despite no living soul being inside. The nearby lords argue over who should claim the fortress, but all hesitate, for the last king of Varroth left a warning carved into his throne: \"The one who sits here shall never leave alive.\"",
    "63": "63 | The Wishing Well of Black Hollow: A forgotten stone well in the heart of Black Hollow Forest has long been whispered about in superstition. Locals say if you drop a coin and whisper a wish, it will come true before the next sunrise—but at a cost. Last night, a farmhand wished for a life of wealth, and this morning he woke in a nobleman’s bed, wearing another man’s clothes, with a wedding ring on his hand. The noble whose place he took has disappeared entirely, as if he never existed. The mayor now begs for someone brave enough to undo what has been done—but the only way to fix it is to wish for something worse.",
    "64": "64 | The Sunken Spire: After weeks of heavy storms, a strange black tower has surfaced in the marshlands, its jagged spires rising from the mud like broken teeth. Local fishermen who dared approach it say the air hums with power, and at night, blue lights flicker in the highest window. No door is visible, but carvings near the base tell a cryptic story of a king buried alive beneath the earth, cursing the land above. The deeper one wades into the marsh, the clearer the whispers become—not warnings, but invitations.",
    "65": "65 | The City Beneath the Sand: A violent sandstorm in the Blistering Wastes has uncovered something long lost—a vast city, half-buried beneath the dunes, its ancient domes and towers barely peeking above the shifting sands. Treasure hunters are already flocking to plunder its riches, but something feels wrong. The city’s doors stand wide open, its streets unnervingly pristine, as if waiting for its people to return. Then, the first explorers begin vanishing, their tracks in the sand stopping mid-step. The last one to disappear left only a single message scrawled into the dirt—\"We woke them.\"",
    "66": "66 | Deliver the Noble’s Heir: A noble family has been wiped out in a coup, their castle burned to the ground, and their banners torn down and replaced. The usurper sits on their stolen throne, but one last surviving heir has been smuggled away before the slaughter. A child, barely old enough to understand their own title, is now the last hope of restoring their house. You have been tasked with escorting them across enemy-controlled lands to reach a distant ally who still supports their claim. But bounty hunters, spies, and assassins are already searching for them—and if the child dies, so does their legacy.",
    "67": "67 | The Priestess’ Journey: The world is out of balance—crops are failing, rivers run dry, and plagues spread through villages. The only hope lies with a young priestess, chosen by the gods to travel to a sacred temple and restore harmony. But the roads are dangerous, filled with bandits, monstrous creatures, and zealots who believe the gods have abandoned the world for a reason. She is devout but naive, trained in rituals but not in survival. If she dies, the gods may turn their backs on the world forever.",
    "68": "68 | The Cursed Caravan: A merchant caravan offers a small fortune for protection as they travel to a distant kingdom. They claim their wares are rare silks, enchanted weapons, and exotic spices, but something isn’t right—the wagons are always locked tight, the merchants whisper among themselves, and at night, strange sounds echo from within the cargo. When one of their own is found dead inside a supply crate, their throat ripped open from within, it becomes clear—you aren’t just guarding a caravan. You’re guarding a secret.",
    "69": "69 | The Wayward Prince: The second son of a powerful king, never meant to rule, never meant to be important, has fled his home after a coup claimed his father’s life. A rival noble house has taken power, and now, every assassin in the kingdom is hunting him down. His only hope? To reach an exiled knight loyal to his family who still holds an army in the neighbouring kingdom. But the prince is no warrior, no tactician—just a frightened young man who barely knows how to wield a sword. Keeping him alive is one thing. Convincing him to be worthy of his father’s throne is another.",
    "70": "70 | The Broken Sword: A legendary blade, once wielded by a hero who slew a god, has been shattered into three pieces, scattered across the land. The only one who can re-forge it is a master smith, now blind, exiled, and hunted by those who fear the sword’s return. Escorting them across the land is difficult enough, but enemies who still remember the blade’s power will stop at nothing to ensure it is never whole again.",
    "71": "71 | The Song of the Starborn: Once a generation, a bard is born with a gift—a voice so powerful it can sway kings, command armies, and bend magic to its will. A prophecy speaks of a Starborn Bard who will decide the fate of the world. The latest bard is barely sixteen, unaware of their own power, and already a target for sorcerers, slavers, and rulers who would claim them as their own. Some wish to train them, others to silence them before they can sing a note. Escorting them to safety may change the world forever—or doom it.",
    "72": "72 | The Dying King’s Final Wish: A once-mighty king lies on his deathbed, but he cannot pass in peace until he completes one final pilgrimage—to the site of his greatest victory, where he swore an oath to his gods. But the journey is long, and he is no longer the warrior he once was. His enemies have not forgotten the wars he started, and those who suffered under his rule would rather see him die unfulfilled. Escorting him means travelling through bitter lands filled with old wounds and grudges—and if you fail, a kingdom will collapse into chaos.",
    "73": "73 | The Forgotten Royal Bastard: A bastard child, born of royal blood but never acknowledged, has spent their life in exile. But now, with the king dead and no heirs remaining, they are the last legitimate claim to the throne. The nobility would rather see the kingdom burn than let them rule, and half the realm’s warlords are already gathering their armies. Escorting them to the capital means navigating treacherous noble politics, avoiding assassins, and proving that blood alone is not enough to rule.",
    "74": "74 | The Witch’s Redemption: Once, she was a great sorceress, feared across the land for her dark magic. But now, her power is broken, her spells weakened, and her enemies closing in. She seeks a cure, a way to restore what she has lost, and claims she knows of an ancient artefact hidden deep in a ruined kingdom. But if you escort her, you may soon find yourself asking: should her power be restored? Or is the world safer without it?",
    "75": "75 | The Lost Tribe’s Return: A nomadic tribe, long thought to be wiped out by war, has returned. Their leader, young and determined, is gathering their people, hoping to reclaim their homeland from those who took it generations ago. The land isn’t empty, and those who rule there will not give it up easily. Escorting them across enemy territory means dealing with old feuds, warlords who remember their ancestors, and traitors who don’t believe in the tribe’s future.",
    "76": "76 | The Dragon’s Last Egg: A dying dragon, once the last of its kind, entrusts you with a single egg, its last hope for the future. If the wrong hands take it, it will be used for dark magic, corrupted before it can hatch. If the dragon-hunters catch you, they will destroy it outright. The only safe place is the Hidden Eyrie, a sanctuary deep in the mountains—but no one has set foot there in a hundred years. The egg is fragile, growing weaker with every day that passes, and if you don’t reach the sanctuary in time, its last heartbeat will fade.",
    "77": "77 | The Arena Slave: You awaken in a pit of blood and sand, the roars of the crowd echoing above. Shackled, bruised, and armed only with a rusted blade, you are the newest spectacle in the Great Arena of Karthul. The rules are simple—fight, survive, and maybe, one day, earn your freedom. But few ever leave the pits alive, and those who do are changed forever. Will you be a pawn in this brutal game, or will you find a way to break the chains and bring the coliseum to ruin?",
    "78": "78 | The Witch Queen’s Captive: You were captured by the dreaded Witch Queen, dragged in chains to her obsidian tower deep in the Blighted Swamp. No one knows why she takes prisoners instead of killing them outright, but those who enter her lair never return. Some say she steals memories, others whisper she twists souls into her monstrous creations. Whatever her purpose, you are next. The doors are locked, the walls are lined with enchantments—escape seems impossible. But one thing is certain: you don’t have much time before she begins the ritual.",
    "79": "79 | The Mine of the Damned: A warlord’s chain gang, a life sentence in a cursed mine—this is your fate. Forced to dig deep into the earth, you and the other prisoners extract a strange, glowing ore that hums with unnatural energy. Some claim the ore whispers to them, others have collapsed into madness. Every week, a prisoner is taken deeper and never seen again. The guards are afraid, but they will never admit it. Something is down there, beneath the rock, and it wants out.",
    "80": "80 | The King’s Scapegoat: You are a condemned traitor, falsely accused of plotting against the throne. The evidence was fabricated, the trial a farce, and now, you await execution in the royal dungeons. But the night before your death, a hooded figure arrives at your cell. \"Your life still has value,\" they whisper, slipping you a dagger and a choice—stay and die, or flee into exile. But even if you escape, you will be hunted as an outlaw. Will you clear your name, seek vengeance, or carve out a new life in the shadows?",
    "81": "81 | The Forsaken Monastery: The once-great Monastery of Yvain was turned into a prison for heretics, a place where those who opposed the clergy were left to rot. You are one such prisoner, accused of heresy, witchcraft, or consorting with demons. The monks bring you meagre rations, their eyes filled with pity—but they dare not intervene. One night, the walls begin to bleed, torches flicker out, and the screams of the other prisoners fall silent. When the lights return, the guards are gone, the doors unbarred. Something has freed you. But why?",
    "82": "82 | The Forgotten Labyrinth: You awaken in a vast, underground labyrinth, its walls lined with ancient, shifting stone. You do not remember how you got here, nor can you recall your own crimes. Other prisoners wander the halls, equally confused, some having been here for years. The only certainty is that something hunts those who stray too far from the torchlight. The exit is said to lie at the heart of the maze, but every path you take seems to change behind you. Is there a way out, or are you doomed to wander forever?",
    "83": "83 | The Blood Debt: You were once a noble, a warrior, a scholar—but now, you are nothing more than a debt slave. Sold to the highest bidder, you belong to a ruthless merchant lord who plans to use you for a task no one else will take. If you succeed, you earn your freedom. If you fail, your corpse will be worth more than your life. The mission? Escort a sealed chest across the Ashen Wastes, a land where the dead do not stay buried. The catch? You are forbidden to look inside.",
    "84": "84 | The Warlock’s Experiment: You were taken—not by slavers, not by kings, but by a warlock obsessed with unlocking the secrets of the soul. Shackled in his dark tower, you have been subjected to strange rituals, your body altered, your very essence tampered with. Some prisoners have lost their minds, others no longer feel pain, hunger, or fear. But tonight, something has gone wrong—the warlock’s spells have backfired, and his tower is collapsing into the void. Will you escape, or will you be forever changed by what was done to you?",
    "85": "85 | The Slave Ship: A prison galley, chains rattling in the dark, the smell of salt and sweat filling your lungs. You are one of many captives, bound for a distant empire where you will be sold to lords, warbands, or worse. The ship’s crew is brutal, the journey long, and the whispers of rebellion stir in the lower decks. But then—a storm. A monstrous wave splinters the hull, throwing the ship into chaos. The chains break, the ship sinks. You have a chance to escape, but the sea is hungry, and the land ahead is unknown.",
    "86": "86 | The Battle for the Sky Citadel: Floating high above the mortal world, the Sky Citadel of Veltharion has remained untouched for centuries, its scholars and warriors watching the world below. But now, the citadel has fallen into chaos. One faction wishes to descend and take control of the land, while the other believes they must remain above, as they always have. The conflict is on the brink of war, and the ruler of Veltharion has called for an outsider’s perspective. You must navigate the politics of the sky, but be warned—some believe an outsider’s presence could tip the balance in the wrong direction.",
    "87": "87 | The War of the Shattered Crown: The High King has died, and three heirs now claim the throne. Each faction gathers its armies, spies, and assassins, waiting for the first blade to be drawn. Some noble houses wish to mediate peace, others long for war and conquest. The old laws dictate that a neutral champion may decide the rightful ruler—and you have been chosen for the task. But with whispers of a fourth heir, long hidden and now returning, the war may not be as simple as it seems.",
    "88": "88 | The Silver Tyrant’s Return: Once, a terrible emperor known as The Silver Tyrant ruled the land, wielding magic so potent it bent reality to his will. He was overthrown, his soul sealed away, and his armies scattered. But now, his followers are gathering once more, and strange omens foretell his resurrection. Some believe he should be destroyed forever, but others—those who remember his reign—whisper that the world was better under his rule. The choice is clear: will you stop him, or help him rise again?",
    "89": "89 | The Desert of Endless Night: A massive, ever-growing storm has engulfed the Sable Wastes, blotting out the sun and plunging the land into eternal twilight. No stars shine, no fires burn for long, and strange creatures have begun to emerge from the shadows. The desert’s people have fled, but an ancient prophecy speaks of a way to restore the sun. The only problem? The prophecy is incomplete, the ruins that hold the truth are buried beneath the shifting sands, and the storm shows no sign of stopping.",
    "90": "90 | The Living Island: Sailors speak of an island that moves, its shores shifting, its mountains never in the same place twice. Some believe it to be a god’s resting place, others say it is a beast disguised as land. Whatever the truth, something calls to you in your dreams, whispering a name you do not recognise. The island has appeared on the horizon, and no ship that sails towards it has ever returned the same.",
    "91": "91 | The Monarch’s Forbidden Love: A ruler, beloved by their people, has been caught in a scandalous affair—not with a noble, but with someone forbidden to them. Their court is divided, their enemies seek to exploit their weakness, and their secret lover is now in grave danger. The monarch has called for someone discreet yet capable, someone who can either save their love from assassination, cover up the scandal, or erase all who would dare to speak of it. What choice will you make?",
    "92": "92 | The Curse of the Moonborn: Every fifty years, a child is born with silver eyes, their soul cursed to be a vessel for an ancient spirit. These children are either slain or exiled before the spirit takes hold. Now, a young girl with silver eyes has been found, and the debate begins once more—kill her now, or take her to the last surviving Moonborn sanctuary, where the truth of her curse may be revealed? The journey is dangerous, for some believe the Moonborn must all be destroyed, and others believe they are the key to undoing the world’s greatest tragedy.",
    "93": "93 | The City That Sings: In the heart of the jungle lies a city made of crystal, its streets glowing with unearthly light. At night, the city sings—a haunting melody that lures travellers closer and closer, until they never leave. Some say it is an ancient prison, others believe it was once the seat of a great empire, but no one has uncovered its secrets. The only certainty? Once you hear the song, it never leaves your mind.",
    "94": "94 | The Feasting Trees: Deep in the western woods, there are trees that move when no one is watching, their roots creeping like serpents through the earth. Travellers vanish, villages on the outskirts disappear overnight, and the few who return speak of whispering voices in the leaves. Now, the forest is growing faster, its edge creeping towards major cities and farmlands. If no one finds out what’s happening within, the land will soon be swallowed by the woods.",
    "95": "95 | The Hand of the Drowned God: A coastal kingdom has been plagued by terrible storms, and their once-thriving ports are now abandoned. The priests claim it is the work of the Drowned God, an entity long worshipped and long ignored. Now, they demand that a sacrifice be made—a noble-born chosen one, thrown into the sea to appease the god’s wrath. But some believe this is nothing more than a power grab, and that the true reason for the storms lies buried beneath the waves.",
    "96": "96 | The Ruins of the First Kingdom: Legends speak of the first kingdom, a civilisation so advanced that its magic built wonders unseen in today’s world. But it vanished overnight, leaving behind only whispers and ruins buried beneath the earth. Now, an explorer has discovered a long-hidden entrance, leading into a forgotten city untouched for thousands of years. But the deeper you go, the more it seems that something is still down there, waiting for its time to rise again.",
    "97": "97 | The Eternal Battlefield: There is a cursed land where the dead never stop fighting. Skeletons locked in an endless war, ghosts reliving the moment of their final breath, rusted weapons clashing as if the war had never ended. No one knows who started it, nor why the warriors refuse to rest. Some say a forgotten war god keeps them bound, others believe a weapon of terrible power was used, locking time in an unbroken loop. The only way to end it is to step onto the battlefield yourself—and take up a sword."
