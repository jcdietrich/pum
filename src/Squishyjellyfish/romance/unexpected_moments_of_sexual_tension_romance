1 | Cramped Quarters: You’re both crammed into a small, confined space (like a cupboard, crawlspace, or vent shaft) with bodies pressed too closely together.  
2 | Interrupted Dressing: One of you walks in on the other while they're half-dressed, revealing more skin than expected. Neither of you looks away fast enough.  
3 | Heated Argument: A heated argument gets physical — chest-to-chest, faces close, voices low and sharp, breaths mingling in the charged air.  
4 | Hands-On Treatment: While treating a wound, one of you has to slide hands across exposed skin, feeling warmth, muscle, and tension beneath your fingertips.  
5 | The Rough Push: A playful argument turns physical — shoving, grabbing, pinning against a wall — and neither of you moves back right away.  
6 | Drenched in Rain: Clothes soaked and clinging to skin, rain dripping down faces, both of you struggling to catch your breath.  
7 | The Long Night Watch: You’re stuck on watch together, the quiet and isolation making every glance and subtle shift feel loaded with meaning.  
8 | Intense Stare-Down: An argument, a challenge, or an unspoken tension builds until you lock eyes — neither of you looks away, and the space between you feels electric.  
9 | Accidental Brush: Hands brush, thighs touch, and no one moves away. The stillness after is more telling than the moment itself.  
10 | The Unexpected Compliment: One of you says something raw and unguarded about the other’s looks, strength, or voice, and for a moment, it lingers.  
11 | Sharing Body Heat: It’s freezing cold, and you’re forced to press close under a shared blanket, feeling every breath, every shift, every heartbeat.  
12 | Out of Breath Together: After running, sparring, or fighting, you both stop to catch your breath — faces close, panting, gazes flicking between lips and eyes.  
13 | The Protective Grip: One of you grabs the other’s waist, arm, or wrist to "keep them safe," but the grip is stronger and lingers longer than it should.  
14 | Scent Recognition: One of you catches the other’s scent — something distinct, addictive, and unexpectedly distracting.  
15 | Silence After the Crowd: Everyone leaves, and it’s just the two of you, too quiet, too aware of the other’s presence.  
16 | Teaching the Move: While teaching a combat move, lockpicking, or a technical task, one of you moves behind the other, guiding their hands or adjusting their stance.  
17 | Drunk Confession: Alcohol makes someone braver than usual, and a flirty comment turns into a bold statement of attraction — and they mean it.  
18 | Glimpse of Vulnerability: Seeing the other at their most raw — battered, exhausted, or stripped of their armour — brings something deeper to the surface.  
19 | Laughter Too Close: A shared laugh leaves you both leaning on each other, breathless and far too close. Neither of you pulls away.  
20 | The Catch: One of you trips, the other catches them, but the moment lasts a bit too long, breaths uneven, eyes locked.  
21 | Shoulder-to-Shoulder: After a shared victory or a close call, you stand side by side, shoulders touching, gazes meeting in silent understanding.  
22 | Lingering Look: The glance lasts longer than it should. One of you looks away, but not before noticing how long the other was staring.  
23 | The Hair Tuck: A stray lock of hair is brushed behind the other’s ear, fingers lingering just a second longer than expected.  
24 | Whispered Words: You lean in to whisper something in the other’s ear, your lips just barely brushing their skin.  
25 | Hand on the Chest: A firm shove or stop presses one of your hands to the other’s chest, and for a second, you feel every heartbeat beneath it.  
26 | Guarding Position: One of you stands in front of the other protectively, bodies so close that warmth and breath are shared.  
27 | Accidental Whisper: Whispered instructions or warnings are spoken too close, lips practically grazing ears, the warmth of breath impossible to ignore.  
28 | Grappling for Control: Training together turns into a wrestling match, leaving one of you pinned, breathless, and painfully aware of how close you both are.  
29 | The Sudden Shift: The air between you changes with no warning — eyes meet, breath catches, and suddenly, it feels like you’re both waiting for the other to make the first move.  
30 | Close Passage: A tight corridor, narrow gap, or crowded event forces you both to press close, chest-to-back or hip-to-hip, with no space to spare.
