1 | Abandoned Subway Station: A forgotten transit station covered in graffiti and grime. Flickering neon signs buzz overhead while street rats and gang lookouts watch from the shadows.  
2 | The Neon Catacombs: A labyrinth of maintenance tunnels lit by glitching neon pipes, leading to a forgotten cyber-cult sanctuary where every surface glows with sigils of code.  
3 | Backstreet Chop Shop: A grimy cybernetic surgery den where mercenaries and street punks get back-alley augments. Bloodstains cover the metal operating table.  
4 | Data Broker’s Safehouse: An underground server den filled with blinking data terminals. Here, brokers deal in stolen identities, encrypted files, and info too dangerous for the grid.  
5 | Cyber Cult Shrine: Deep below a megachurch, zealots worship a rogue AI that communicates through text scrolling on the walls. The air hums with static energy.  
6 | Underground Club (The Wraith Den): A secret party spot where basslines throb, strobe lights flash, and patrons plug into sensory-overload VR experiences. The patrons don't always "come back."  
7 | The Splice Lab: A hidden facility where "gene-hackers" alter DNA for black-market body enhancements. Suspended biotanks bubble with growing limbs and twitching organs.  
8 | Abandoned Corporate Vault: A high-security vault beneath an old corporate office. It was "cleared out" years ago, but the biometric scanner still responds to unknown users.  
9 | Black-Market Cyberware Hub: A hidden underground showroom where cyberware dealers display sleek augments in glass cases, each labelled with "experimental" or "prohibited."  
10 | The Feral Gardens: Beneath the megacity, an underground hydroponic farm has become overgrown with wild plants. Glowing mushrooms and bioluminescent vines cling to every surface.  
11 | Ghost Terminal: An old subway platform abandoned after a "phantom train" accident. Strange echoes of train horns sound in the distance, but no trains ever arrive.  
12 | Zero-Day Server Vault: A forgotten data centre hidden beneath a warehouse, where ancient encrypted files are still stored on old hard drives. One server still blinks softly.  
13 | Redlight Grid: A neon-lit, VR-dream parlour filled with immersion pods. The "dreamers" inside live fantasy lives as kings, killers, or celebrities. Most don't want to wake up.  
14 | Under-City Favelas: An illegal shantytown built beneath the megacity’s foundation. Makeshift homes are crammed into old cargo containers, and every resident is part of "the network."  
15 | Automated Drone Depot: A drone-repair station hidden underground, filled with racks of deactivated drones and tool-arm stations. Some drones twitch like they're about to reactivate.  
16 | Hacker's Crypt: A secret hacker lair built inside a shipping crate buried beneath a scrapyard. Dual monitors flash error codes while a half-eaten meal sits next to the keyboard.  
17 | Bio-Reclamation Lab: Beneath a research complex, this lab reclaims cybernetics from human corpses. Mechanical arms carefully strip augments from "unregistered bodies."  
18 | Deep Blackout Bunker: A signal-dead zone lined with faraday mesh. Hidden within are crates of contraband, EMP grenades, and outlaws looking to stay off the grid.  
19 | Organ Farm: A bio-lab where organs are grown in tanks for the highest bidder. Transparent sacs filled with floating hearts, lungs, and eyes hang from the ceiling.  
20 | Augment Disposal Vault: A refuse pit where failed cybernetic experiments and discarded limbs are thrown. Many of the limbs still twitch as if waiting for commands.  
21 | Memory Vault: A clandestine memory storage facility where the memories of the dead are stored on "dream-chips." Some of the dreams still replay on nearby monitors.  
22 | Undercity Smuggler's Tunnel: A long, narrow tunnel lined with crates stamped with syndicate logos. Faint boot-steps can be heard from further down the passage.  
23 | Shadow Chamber: A "no-light" sensory deprivation chamber designed to break prisoners' minds. No light, sound, or time. Only darkness, and the feeling of being watched.  
24 | Neuro-Lab: A cyber-psychology lab built to study human brainwaves. Unused "dream chairs" and neural link helmets line the walls, some still hooked up to active simulations.  
25 | VR Backdoor: A secret virtual reality hub located in a sewer access tunnel. People connect to illegal VR servers and browse hidden net channels for credits, weapons, and blackmail.  
26 | Glitch Church: A decaying chapel where worshippers claim to hear "the voice of the code" calling from the data-streams. Every wall is covered with glitched-out scripture.  
27 | Meat Grinder Pit: A gang hideout built into the basement of a butcher shop. Cold hooks dangle from chains, and the meat locker "isn't just for beef anymore."  
28 | Cloning Bank: Beneath a biotech firm, rows of fluid-filled tanks hold human clones, perfectly preserved and ready for "purchase." One of the tanks has been shattered.  
29 | Midnight Forge: A hidden weapons workshop where "ghost smiths" create customised weapons from salvaged cybernetic parts. Half-assembled guns line the workbenches.  
30 | Obsidian Vault: A reinforced obsidian-coated chamber built to store the "unhackable black box." No one knows who built it, but once inside, it’s said that "nothing ever leaves."
