3 | Arid Dry Winds: Dry winds blow across the land, carrying dust and grit. The heat drains energy from all living things.  
4 | Sandstorm: A powerful sandstorm rolls in, reducing visibility to a few feet. Sand whips at exposed skin, making breathing difficult.

6 | Sweltering Humidity: The air is thick and muggy. Sweat clings to skin, and every breath feels like inhaling a hot, wet cloth.  
7 | Sudden Heatwave: The temperature surges unexpectedly, making it almost unbearable to move. Exhaustion comes quickly.  
8 | Dust Devil: A swirling mini-tornado of dust and sand twists through the landscape. It's harmless but unnerving to watch.  
9 | Blinding Sun Glare: The angle of the sun causes an intense glare, making it difficult to see without shading your eyes.  
10 | Cloudless Sky: The sky is a deep, perfect blue, with not a single cloud for miles. The heat radiates freely.  
11 | Boiling Rain: Scalding rain falls from the sky, evaporating on contact with the ground. Everything becomes slick and dangerously hot.
