1 | Clear and Cold: The sky is a bright, crisp blue, and the sun reflects blindingly off the snow. The air bites at exposed skin.  
2 | Overcast and Grey: Thick, featureless grey clouds blanket the sky, muting all natural light. Shadows are faint and diffused.  
3 | Light Snowfall: Small, soft snowflakes drift from the sky, coating everything in a thin white layer. Visibility is unaffected.  
4 | Heavy Snowfall: Large, fluffy snowflakes fall heavily, covering the ground rapidly. Tracks are quickly obscured.  
5 | Snowstorm (Blizzard): Harsh winds whip snow into a frenzy, creating whiteout conditions where visibility is nearly zero.  
6 | Freezing Rain: Icy rain falls from the sky, coating everything in a thin layer of ice, making walking, climbing, and riding extremely dangerous.  
7 | Frosted Ground: Overnight frost coats every surface, from blades of grass to exposed metal. It's slippery underfoot.  
8 | Howling Winds: Sharp, bitter winds howl through the area, carrying flecks of ice that sting exposed skin and eyes.  
9 | Sudden Temperature Drop: The air suddenly becomes frigid, and frost begins forming on armour, clothes, and even eyelashes.  
10 | Ice Fog: A thick fog rolls in, freezing in the air, making it feel like inhaling shards of glass. Visibility is poor.  
11 | Whiteout Conditions: A complete whiteout as heavy snow, thick fog, and powerful winds reduce visibility to zero. Shadows vanish.  
12 | Hailstorm: Hard pellets of ice fall from the sky, striking armour, roofs, and flesh with painful force. The sound echoes like drumming.  
13 | Chilling Silence: Everything is unnervingly quiet. The snow absorbs sound, and not a single bird, beast, or wind can be heard.  
14 | Frozen Lake Fog: Fog rises from a frozen lake or river, swirling and moving slowly like a living creature.  
15 | Snow Dunes: Snow has drifted into high dunes or ridges, creating impassable terrain without climbing or wading through.  
16 | Biting Wind Chill: The wind slices through clothing and armour, making the cold feel even more intense. Prolonged exposure risks frostbite.  
17 | Glacial Icefall: Large chunks of ice break free from a nearby glacier, crashing to the ground with thunderous force.  
18 | Ice Needles: Frozen rain turns into tiny, sharp needles of ice driven by the wind. They sting exposed skin and reduce visibility.  
19 | Sudden Thaw: Temperatures rise suddenly, causing snow to melt into slush and ice to crack and shift underfoot.  
20 | Aurora Borealis: The northern lights dance in brilliant hues of green, blue, and purple across the sky, illuminating the snowy landscape below.
