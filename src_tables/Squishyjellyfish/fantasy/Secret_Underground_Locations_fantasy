4 | Subterranean Lake: A vast underground lake with eerily still water. Glowing fish and unseen predators move beneath the surface.  
5 | Dwarven Forge-Hall: An ancient dwarven forge, its magma-heated forges still burning faintly. Tools and broken weapons lie scattered.

11 | Serpent’s Den: A dark, humid cavern where giant snakes slither through cracks in the rock, shedding their old skins everywhere.
