5 | The Widow's Walk: A rickety rooftop walkway connecting old, sagging tenements, often used as a secret escape route by thieves.  
6 | The Mud Passage: A low, narrow passage between two buildings that fills with sludge after every rain, making it impossible to cross cleanly.

11 | The Cobbler’s Row: A cramped street lined with tiny shops where cobblers repair shoes while barefoot beggars wait for scraps of leather.
