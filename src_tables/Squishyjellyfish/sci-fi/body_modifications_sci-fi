1 | Neuro-Enhancement Implant: A neural chip that accelerates thought processes, allowing for rapid learning, multitasking, and faster reaction times. Side Effect: Overuse can cause "info burn," a state of mental exhaustion.  
2 | Cybernetic Arm Replacement: A fully robotic arm with retractable tools, a built-in taser, and magnetic grip. Side Effect: The arm occasionally "twitches" when exposed to EMP fields.  
3 | Subdermal Armour Plating: Lightweight metal plates embedded beneath the skin, granting resistance to bullets and blunt force trauma. Side Effect: The plates cause slight muscle tension, making precise movements more difficult.  
4 | Ocular Augmentation (Holo-Vision): Eyes are replaced with holographic projection lenses, capable of scanning objects and displaying digital readouts. Side Effect: Sudden flashes of light can cause "visual static" in the augmented view.  
5 | Retractable Claws: Razor-sharp claws hidden in the fingers, capable of extending and retracting on command. Side Effect: Slight discomfort in the fingertips when idle, as the claws are coiled inside.  
6 | Bio-Regen Implants: Nanomachines injected into the bloodstream, allowing for rapid healing of wounds and fractures. Side Effect: Users experience intense itching during regeneration and sometimes grow temporary "scar tissue" webs.  
7 | Enhanced Olfactory Sensor: The nose is augmented with a micro-analyser, capable of detecting poisons, chemicals, and subtle odours. Side Effect: Overpowering smells can cause sensory overload, resulting in nausea.  
8 | Synaptic Reflex Booster: A spinal modification that speeds up reflexes, granting "bullet-time" awareness during combat. Side Effect: Sudden movements or bright lights cause muscle spasms or unintentional reflexive actions.  
9 | Hidden Compartment Cavity: A concealed storage space inside the user's thigh, abdomen, or chest cavity. Side Effect: Painful cramping occurs when objects are stored for too long.  
10 | Audio Frequency Enhancer (Ear Mod): Enhanced hearing allowing the user to pick up frequencies beyond normal human perception, including radio waves. Side Effect: High-pitched sounds (like alarms) can cause migraines.  
11 | Skeletal Reinforcement: Bones are reinforced with titanium or advanced polymers, making them unbreakable under normal conditions. Side Effect: Increased body weight results in slower swimming and jumping abilities.  
12 | Synthetic Skin (Chameleon Shift): A skin overlay that allows for adaptive camouflage, blending the user into their surroundings. Side Effect: The skin sometimes "flickers" uncontrollably, revealing the user’s location.  
13 | Dual-Lung Respirator: Lungs are modified to filter toxins and breathe in low-oxygen environments. Side Effect: The user occasionally experiences "breathing lag" — a 2-second delay before gasping for air.  
14 | Optical Laser (Eye Mod): One or both eyes contain low-power laser emitters, useful for precision cutting and welding. Side Effect: Prolonged use causes irritation and "burn lines" in the user’s vision.  
15 | Combat Tail (Spinal Mod): A prehensile, cybernetic tail designed for balance, attack, or utility purposes. Side Effect: Unconscious tail movements cause furniture to be knocked over frequently.  
16 | Subdermal Storage Pods: Small compartments within the arms, legs, or torso for storing small objects or emergency tools. Side Effect: Pressure changes cause the compartments to "pop" open unexpectedly.  
17 | Synthetic Muscle Weave: Replacing human muscle fibres with synthetic biotech, giving enhanced strength and stamina. Side Effect: Excessive use causes intense muscle fatigue, and synthetic fibres need periodic reconditioning.  
18 | Voice Modulator (Throat Implant): Allows the user to mimic voices and speak in various languages. Side Effect: Occasional "glitching" causes the user's voice to randomly shift into another tone or pitch.  
19 | Energy Absorption Grid (Skin Mod): Skin covered with a conductive nano-grid that absorbs and stores energy from electrical shocks and energy weapons. Side Effect: Static electricity builds up in the user’s body, resulting in accidental discharges when touching metal.  
20 | Reinforced Cybernetic Legs: Legs replaced with cybernetic enhancements that grant increased speed, agility, and higher jumping capability. Side Effect: Sudden "leg lock" occurs under extreme conditions, temporarily immobilising the user.  
21 | Bio-Luminescent Skin: Skin cells altered to produce bio-luminescent patterns, useful for signalling, identification, or artistic purposes. Side Effect: The glow remains active during sleep, potentially revealing the user's position.  
22 | Enhanced Pain Suppression (Nerve Mod): Neural pathways are re-routed to reduce the perception of pain. Side Effect: Inability to detect dangerous injuries, leading to unnoticed bleeding or fractures.  
23 | Datajack (Brain-Port): A direct neural interface that allows the user to plug into devices, computers, and networks. Side Effect: When disconnected abruptly, "data lag" leaves the user with temporary short-term memory loss.  
24 | Hydration Regulator (Body Mod): Body is altered to store extra hydration, reducing the need for frequent water consumption. Side Effect: Excessive sweating occurs in high-heat environments, causing dehydration if unchecked.  
25 | Combat Talons (Foot Mod): Cybernetic talons attached to the feet, allowing for climbing walls or kicking with lethal force. Side Effect: Shoes or boots are difficult to wear, requiring custom footwear.  
26 | Augmented Reality Overlay (Eye Mod): Implant that overlays AR (augmented reality) data directly into the user's vision. Side Effect: "AR Ghosting" sometimes occurs, where past overlays briefly reappear.  
27 | Cybernetic Heart (Cardio Replacement): A fully synthetic heart that never tires, allowing for extended endurance. Side Effect: Heartbeat becomes inaudible, making it difficult for medical scans to detect life signs.  
28 | Bone Blades (Forearm Modification): Retractable bone-like blades extend from the user's forearms, useful for close combat. Side Effect: The bones must be "reset" manually after use, causing severe pain.  
29 | Thermo-Optic Cloaking (Full Body Mod): An advanced cloaking system that renders the user nearly invisible to the naked eye. Side Effect: Prolonged use overheats the user’s body, forcing them to "cool down" afterward.  
30 | Self-Repairing Limbs: Limbs are equipped with microbots that repair damage automatically. Side Effect: Repairs require raw materials, and users must consume large amounts of protein to fuel the process.
