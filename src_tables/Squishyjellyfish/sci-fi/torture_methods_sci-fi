    "9": "10 | Kinetic Spine Rack – spine extended and compressed by mechanical pressure at random intervals.",
    "10": "11 | Acid Mist Exposure – a mild corrosive vapour eats at flesh slowly, never enough to kill, always enough to burn.",
    "11": "12 | Cognitive Desync – victim’s brain is forced to process time at irregular speeds—seconds stretch into hours.",
    "12": "13 | Stimulation Overdrive – neural pleasure centres are activated uncontrollably until the body is wrecked by fatigue.",
    "13": "14 | Forced Cloning Decay – subject watches deteriorating clones of themselves fail, melt, and beg for release.",
    "14": "15 | Echo Isolation Chamber – locked in a room where every sound echoes louder, clearer, and increasingly distorted.",
    "15": "16 | Pulsefire Branding – plasma needles engrave symbols across the body, layer by layer.",
    "16": "17 | Symbiote Insertion – alien parasite inserted into the body, causing unpredictable spasms and hallucinations.",
    "17": "18 | Retinal Burn Strobe – a strobing beam sears retina patterns into the brain, inducing temporary blindness and seizures.",
    "18": "19 | Bio-Stitch Field – nano-stitches thread through skin and muscle, pulling open healed wounds repeatedly.",
    "19": "20 | Magnetic Bone Pull – implants in the bones react violently to magnetic shifts, wrenching joints from within.",
    "20": "21 | Stasis Blistering – time is frozen for parts of the body, disrupting circulation and causing tissue collapse.",
    "21": "22 | Synthetic Skin Shedding – an artificial epidermis grafted to the body sloughs off in painful cycles.",
    "22": "23 | Antigrav Inversion Cell – internal gravity is flipped repeatedly, disorienting fluids and perception.",
    "23": "24 | Language Corruption Injection – a nanovirus disables linguistic comprehension, replacing all speech with nonsense.",
    "24": "25 | Limb Echo Loop – every movement is echoed seconds later in reverse, wrenching joints and causing trauma.",
    "25": "26 | Sonic Spike Resonance – specific frequencies trigger pain in bones, teeth, and inner ear.",
    "26": "27 | Bioluminal Exposure – skin is made hypersensitive to light, causing burns from even dim surfaces.",
    "27": "28 | Cortex Tap Leak – information is pulled directly from their memory and played aloud in public.",
    "28": "29 | Waste Recirculator – dehydrated, then forced to drink chemically recycled waste until organs fail.",
    "29": "30 | Spinal Fibre Extraction – nerves teased out fibre by fibre through the vertebrae using surgical bots.",
    "30": "31 | Forced Empathy Overload – made to feel others’ pain, fear, and memories in a continuous stream.",
    "31": "32 | Nerve Mapping Virus – a targeted bio-code triggers the nervous system to react randomly and violently.",
    "32": "33 | Temporal Fragmentation – the subject is conscious across multiple timelines simultaneously, unable to track reality.",
    "33": "34 | Fluctuation Field Pressure – a pressurised energy field alternately crushes and expands organs.",
    "34": "35 | Corneal Peel – thin layers of the eye are drawn away slowly with precision lasers.",
    "35": "36 | Exo-Skeletal Crush Frame – a mechanical frame tightens over time, fracturing ribs and limbs methodically.",
    "36": "37 | Emotive Drain Collar – emotions are harvested to fuel a device, leaving the victim cold and blank.",
    "37": "38 | Harmonic Disruption Bath – submerged in vibrating gel that breaks molecular stability, causing tissue distortion.",
    "38": "39 | Voice Loop Implant – an audio loop of their own voice speaking betrayals plays in their skull continuously.",
    "39": "40 | Synthetic Hive Lice – nanobots designed like insects crawl beneath the skin, feeding off cellular energy.",
    "40": "41 | Ocular Feed Override – eyes replaced with a feed of synthetic horrors directly wired into vision.",
    "41": "42 | Internal Pulse Bombardment – micro-explosives embedded in muscle detonate with dull thumps at nerve points.",
    "42": "43 | Cranial Echo Chamber – the inside of their skull echoes thoughts back louder and delayed.",
    "43": "44 | Bio-Rejection Therapy – their own immune system is tricked into attacking random organs.",
    "44": "45 | Liquid Metal Drip – a slow flow of programmable alloy coats limbs, hardens, then peels back the skin.",
    "45": "46 | Sensory Dampening Pod – all senses are muted except for pain, which is enhanced and centralised.",
    "46": "47 | Feedback Loop Gauntlets – every time they resist, pain surges through the nervous system exponentially.",
    "47": "48 | Static Chain Armour – suit of electrified links that jolts on each movement, tracking muscle contractions.",
    "48": "49 | Tissue Memory Infusion – artificial trauma memories are written directly into muscle fibres.",
    "49": "50 | Voice Erasure – vocal cords are removed or rewritten, stealing all tone and identity from speech.",
    "50": "51 | Auto-Grafting Leech Gel – black sludge binds to skin, creating painful, useless appendages.",
