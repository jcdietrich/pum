    "0": "1 | A withered oak, standing alone in the middle of a barren field, its gnarled roots breaking through the earth. Villagers believe it marks the site of a forgotten battle, its branches swaying even when no wind stirs.",
    "1": "2 | A narrow stone bridge, cracked and uneven, spanning a deep river. The stones are worn smooth by centuries of travellers, and moss creeps between them, softening each footstep.",
    "2": "3 | A ruined watchtower, its upper levels long since collapsed. The lower chamber still offers shelter to passing travellers, though the damp smell of decay lingers inside.",
    "3": "4 | A circle of ancient standing stones, half-buried in the soil, their surfaces carved with unreadable markings. Shepherds avoid the place, claiming the air always feels heavier near the stones.",
    "4": "5 | A scarred battlefield, now covered in wild grass. Rusted sword hilts and broken spearheads still jut from the ground, half-buried beneath the earth.",
    "5": "6 | A frozen lake, its surface smooth and unbroken, even in the warmth of spring. The villagers say it never fully thaws, though no one knows why.",
    "6": "7 | A dense woodland, so thick with undergrowth that no sunlight reaches the forest floor. The deeper one ventures, the quieter the world becomes, swallowed by the hush of ancient trees.",
    "7": "8 | A stone well, its edges worn from years of use. The water is fresh, but a strange echo rises from its depths whenever a bucket is lowered.",
    "8": "9 | A mountain path, so narrow that two men cannot walk side by side. Loose stones tumble easily, making each step a test of balance.",
    "9": "10 | A noble’s abandoned estate, the roof half-collapsed, ivy crawling over the stone walls. The air inside is thick with dust, and the scent of damp wood fills every room.",
    "10": "11 | A cobblestone road, older than the nearest village, its surface uneven with age. On rainy days, the stones glisten like polished steel.",
    "11": "12 | A fishing village, perched on a rocky cliffside. The smell of salt and fish hangs in the air, and the wooden docks creak under the weight of the boats.",
    "12": "13 | A series of cave dwellings, carved directly into the cliff face. The interiors are smooth, as if shaped by careful hands, yet no records remain of who lived here.",
    "13": "14 | A collapsed monastery, its stone walls crumbling into the earth. A single wooden cross still stands at the altar, untouched by the passage of time.",
    "14": "15 | A riverbend, where the water pools into a deep, silent basin before continuing downstream. Fishermen swear that the largest fish always hide beneath its still surface.",
    "15": "16 | A dusty road, carved deep into the hills by the passage of wagons. When the wind blows, it carries the scent of dry earth and trampled grass.",
    "16": "17 | A valley filled with wildflowers, their colours shifting with the seasons. In the summer, it is a sea of golden wheat-like grass, rippling under the breeze.",
    "17": "18 | A quarry, long abandoned, its walls lined with chiselled grooves where stone once was cut. The echoes of footsteps carry strangely in the deep pit.",
    "18": "19 | A farmland, stretching to the horizon, dotted with small thatched huts. The fields are worked from dawn to dusk, the scent of soil and sweat thick in the air.",
    "19": "20 | A hilltop fortress, its walls standing strong despite years of siege. Arrows still lie scattered at its base, half-buried in the dirt.",
    "20": "21 | A blacksmith’s forge, its stone chimney still standing tall, though no fires have burned there for years. The anvil is rusted, but its surface remains smooth.",
    "21": "22 | A long-forgotten road, disappearing into the underbrush. Only faint traces of old wagon ruts remain, hinting at travellers long since gone.",
    "22": "23 | A deep ravine, carved by an ancient river. Birds nest along its steep walls, their calls echoing from below.",
    "23": "24 | A wooden bridge, barely wide enough for a horse cart, its planks groaning under the weight of travellers. The rope railings are weathered and frayed.",
    "24": "25 | A marshland, thick with reeds and slow-moving water. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth, and the buzzing of insects never ceases.",
    "25": "26 | A shepherd’s hut, nestled in the hills, its stone walls built to withstand harsh winters. The door is barely holding together, tied shut with twine.",
    "26": "27 | A stone wall, stretching across the landscape, broken in places but still standing. No one knows who built it, or what it once guarded.",
    "27": "28 | A rocky coastline, where the waves crash violently against jagged cliffs. The remains of a shipwreck lie tangled in the rocks below.",
    "28": "29 | A dirt road lined with fruit trees, planted long ago by an unknown hand. The branches are heavy with ripe apples, though no village lies nearby.",
    "29": "30 | A wooden palisade, abandoned but still standing, its sharpened stakes blackened by old fire. The remains of an iron gate lie rusting in the grass.",
    "30": "31 | A hunting lodge, its doors swinging open in the wind. Inside, the wooden beams creak, and old pelts hang from the walls.",
    "31": "32 | A mountain pass, where the cliffs rise so high that the sun barely touches the ground. The air is cold, and the silence is absolute.",
    "32": "33 | A dry riverbed, cracked and parched, its once-powerful current now a mere trickle of water.",

    "34": "35 | A roadside shrine, its small wooden cross weathered and cracked, left behind by a passing pilgrim.",
    "35": "36 | A farmstead, abandoned with its wooden fence still standing. The doors of the barn swing lazily in the wind, revealing rusting tools within.",
    "36": "37 | A watchtower, built upon a rocky outcrop. The wooden beams groan with age, but the view from the top stretches for miles.",
    "37": "38 | A small fishing dock, half-submerged in the river, its planks rotting and loose.",
    "38": "39 | A deep well, covered by an iron grate. Locals claim that it was sealed long ago to keep something from climbing out.",
